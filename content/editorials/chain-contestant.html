        i should probably actually start porting my gists
    </p>
    <p>
        anyways, new problem, new sussy official code, you know the drill by now
    </p>
    <p>
        it asks for a string of max len 1000 and <b><i>max 10 char types</i></b> how many
        subsequences of the string have all the same characters together
    </p>
    <p>
        so right off the bat given that there's a really small bound we know that
        this is bitwise dp<br/>
        (aka we have to solve a problem on all subsets of <i>something</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
        i know what you're thinking
        (probably, idk i'm not anya from spy x family
        [btw watch it it's a good anime that's still airing rn omg she's so cute])
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        sooo we just frickin define it as
        ```
        dp[subset] = # of valid subsequences given that we
                     only think abt the characters in the subset?
        ```
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        ok buddy, i'll take you up on that offer<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        but like if that's the case, why would they make the number of char types <i>10</i> instead of <i>20</i>?
        and even more important is <b>how the everloving heck are we going to transition?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        (btw that was a rhetorical question i don't think there's a way)<br/>
        usually when you have problems transitioning a way to remedy it is to add another dimension
        to your dp array
    </p>
    <p>
        so lemme just add something to your dp real quick
        ```
        dp[subset][char_num] = # of valid subsequences given that:
                                1. we only use the characters in the subset
                                2. we only think about the first char_num characters
        ```
    </p>
    <p>
        there! that should make it much, much easier to transition<br/>
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        so if you forgot, with bitwise dp we remove each element from the current subset & see
        how the previous subset without said element affects the current subset
    </p>
    <p>
        so i hope it's evident enough that given this array, you know that to transition we do this:
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary>click this for the idea, i'll let you think a little</summary>
        <ol>
            <li>iterate through all current elements in the subset</li>
            <li>
                see how many ways there are if we tack on the removed element to the end of all subsequences
                of the <i>previous</i> subset
            </li>
        </ol>
    </details>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        armed with this general idea, we now arrive at our main challenge:
        we have an array like so:
        ```
        prev[i] = # of valid subsequences of a prev subset
                  given that only the first i chars are considered
        ```
        and now we have to create a new array that we're going to add on to
        our current subset array that i'll define like so:
        ```
        curr[i] = # of valid subsequences with that prev subset and our current character
                  guaranteed to be at the end (or just not there at all, that's also an option)
                  (also given that only the first i chars are considered)
        ```
    </p>
    <p>
        gonna be honest, it's kinda (well it was really hard for me) to come up with an
        actual relation between these two arrays without actually coding up some examples
        <br/>
        so now would be a good time to just code it up yourself<br/>
        or don't<br/>
        if you're here you've probably given up entirely tbh
    </p>

    <p>
        but anyways, the structure of our array relation<br/>
        we iterate through all characters & there's 3 cases<br/>
        (btw i defined the current index to be `at` in the editorial, diff from in the code)
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            isn't even <i>in</i> the subset we're processing, bruh<br/>
            in that case we just set `curr[at] = curr[at - 1]` and move on with our day
        </li>
        <li>
            is the character that we plan to tack on to the end!<br/>
            this is a completely new character that `prev` has no goddamn clue about<br/>
            for this case, we do `curr[at] = 2 * curr[at - 1] + 1`- we either tack it onto the end
            or we don't, and there's another choice where we start a completely new subsequence with
            that current character
        </li>
        <li>
            or it's just part of the previous subset we're processing<br/>
            in that case it's this thing:<br/>
            `curr[at] = curr[at - 1] + prev[at] - prev[at - 1]`<br/>
            tbh forgot why it is this way lmao, i think i figured this out just by looking
            at some examples<br/>
            a plausible explanation is we add the previous ones and the ones the previous
            subset has got figured out<br/>
            but we overcounted the ones the `prev` <b>AND</b> `curr` have figured out,
            so we subtract `prev[at - 1]`
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        so now we can just add `curr` onto our array and move on, right?<br/>
        yeah... turns out by doing that we overcount and have to subtract `prev` from
        the array as well<br/>
        this is so that we count the ones that actually have the current character-
        the others ones are handled by the other characters we've iterated or are going
        to iterate through
