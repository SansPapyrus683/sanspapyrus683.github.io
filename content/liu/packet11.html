<h2>constructing a confidence interval for \(p_1-p_2\)</h2>

<h3>CI for \(p_1-p_2\)</h3>

<p>
    basically the same as the CIs you've done before<br/>
    just check the 10% & large counts condition for both populations and that
    they're <i>independently</i> randomly sampled<br/>
    also now \(\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_1}(1-\hat{p_1})}{n_1}-\frac{\hat{p_2}(1-\hat{p_2})}{n_2}}\)
</p>

<p>
    <b>interpretation:</b> same as normal<br/>
    <b>interpretation DLC:</b> the interval suggests that the true proportion of [\(p_1\) ctx]
    is between [a% lower/higher] & [b% lower/higher] than of [\(p_2\) ctx]
</p>

<h3>some stuff that should be pretty obvious</h3>

<p>
    so if [a, b]'s our CI
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>if a's + & b's +</b> then the first proportion is greater</li>
    <li><b>if a's - & b's -</b> then the second proportion is greater</li>
    <li><b>if a's - & b's +</b> then IDK</li>
</ul>

<h2>tests about a diff in proportions - intro</h2>

<h3>hypotheses</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>\(H_0\):</b> \(p_1-p_2=0\)</li>
    <li><b>\(H_a\):</b> \(p_1-p_2<\text{, }\neq\text{, or }>0\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    remember to define \(p_1-p_2\) w/ context & make sure to specify which is which
</p>

<h3>conditions (jfc how many times am i gonna have to do this)</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>rng:</b> either independent random samples (for generalizable results)
        or random assignment (to prove causation)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>10%:</b> same thing, keep in mind this is for no replacement sampling only-
        if we're doing an experiment it isn't needed
    </li>
    <li><b>large counts:</b> same thing but use the one probability \(\hat{p_c}=\frac{x_1+x_2}{n_1+n_2}\)</li>
</ul>

<h2>tests about a diff in proportions - fuck you i'm writing this while sick editionâ„¢</h2>

<h3>state: (param, hypos stat, & \(\alpha\))</h3>

<p>
    basically the same as how the hypothesis test worked last time, again, just be sure to specify
    the direction and say \(p_1-p_2\) and \(\hat{p_1}-\hat{p_2}\)
</p>

<h3>plan: (name & checks)</h3>

<p>
    name is two-prop z-test for \(p_1-p_2\)
</p>

<p>
    again, basically the same, just don't do the 10% check if it's rng assignment for some reason
    and use \(\hat{p_c}\) when doing large counts
</p>

<h3>do: (formula, work, & pic?)</h3>

<p>
    ditto except now it's
    \(\sigma_{\hat{p_c}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_c}(1-\hat{p_c})}{n_1}-\frac{\hat{p_c}(1-\hat{p_c})}{n_2}}\)
</p>

<p>
    <b>conclude: (if you still don't know what to do at this point you're hopeless)</b>
</p>

<p>
    finally. fuck off. fuck this. fuck you. fuck liu.
    my head feels like it's clogged with mucus and both my nostrils are nonexistent.
</p>

<h2>type i & type ii errors</h2>

<p>
    <b>type i:</b> you rejected when you shouldn't have<br/>
    \(P(\text{type i})=\alpha\)<br/>
    <b>interpretation:</b> "[\(H_0\) ctx] true, but we've convincing evidence for [\(H_a\) ctx]"
</p>

<p>
    <b>type ii:</b> you didn't reject when you should've<br/>
    <b>interpretation:</b> "[\(H_a\) ctx] true, but we've'nt convincing evidence for [\(H_a\) ctx]"
</p>

<h2>power of a test</h2>

<h3>POWER??? FROM CHAINSAW MAN???</h3>

<img src="img/packet11/power.png" alt="power, the character based on eric cartman from chainsaw man" class="center half-img"/>

<p>
    unfortunately it's not<br/>
    the power of a test is the chance that you reject \(H_0\) when you should, i.e. when \(H_a\) is true
</p>

<p>
    <b>interpretation:</b> "if \(H_a\) is true [plus some \(H_a\) context] there's a [power] chance that we find
    convicing evidence to reject [\(H_0\) context]"
</p>

<p>
    to increase power, you can do some things<br/>
    increase \(\alpha\), increase n, or increase the distance from \(H_a\) to the base claim (effective size)
</p>

<h2>finding chance of type ii error</h2>

<p>
    i'm willing to bet my right kidney that liu's going to include this on the test, so here's how to find it
</p>

<img src="img/packet11/null.png" alt="normal distr" class="center half-img"/>

<p>
    this, is ol' reliable.<br/>
    our null distribution. the default distribution.<br/>
    it's what we use to base all our hypothesis tests on, and it's nice!
</p>

<p>
    <b>BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A FUCKING LIAR.</b>
</p>

<img src="img/packet11/null_alt.png" alt="2 normal distrs" class="center half-img"/>

<p>
    let's say it's actually wrong, and the dark blue distribution is the true distribution in the world!
</p>

<p>
    the thing is, we've no fucking clue.<br/>
    we only have our z-test and some idea of how far away it is
</p>

<p>
    so let's define our alpha boundaries
</p>

<img src="img/packet11/null_alt_bounds.png" alt="ok, now we have our alpha shit" class="center half-img"/>

<p>
    if we got anything within those boundaries, we'd reject the null hypothesis and have the alternate distribution
    get back it's rightful position as the true distribution
</p>

<p>
    the thing is, the chance we get that, if you can see...is pretty fucking slim<br/>
</p>

<img src="img/packet11/alt_prob.png" alt="the chances do not look good" class="center half-img"/>

<p>
    NOTE that IRL we're actually sampling from the alt distr when we think we're sampling from the null distr!!!<br/>
    for us to realize it, we have to get something in that light green area
    (there's a bit on the left as well but it's covered by the bastard null distr)
</p>

<p>
    so given that diagram, the probability of a type ii error is the dark blue area
    (again, some is hidden by the null distr)
</p>

<p>
    now in actual math terms, here's how you find the chance of a type ii error
</p>

<ol>
    <li>use \(\text{invNorm}\) with the <i>null distr parameters</i> to get where the red bounds are</li>
    <li>use \(\text{normalCDF}\) with the <i>alternate distr parameters</i> to get the area of the blue shit</li>
</ol>

<p>
    and i think i said this before, but power is just 1 - P(type ii error) so yeah
