<h1>eggert specs if they were good</h1>

<p>
    i've found that eggert specs are just horribly written and incredibly vague,
    so i'll endeavour to make better versions of them on this site<br/>
    the license on the course site said it's like gnu general public license or whatever<br/>
    there's a pretty big chance i won't have him for cs 111 or 131 so if you're looking for those you're outta luck lol
</p>

<p>
    <span class="big"><b>IF ANYTHING A TA/EGGERT SAYS CONTRADICTS WHAT IS SAID HERE, LISTEN TO <i>THEM</i>!!</b></span>
</p>

<h2>cs35l</h2>

<p>
    it's called 35l because you take nothing but L's in that class<br/>
    <b>these specs are based on the winter 24 version- if any change occurs email `sanspapyrus683@ucla.edu`</b>
</p>

<p>
    oh real quick, a cool resource is these <a href="https://tldr.sh/">tldr pages</a><br/>
    they're like man pages, but better<br/>
    but anyways, here's the assignment specs
</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="cs35l/assign1.html">assignment 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="cs35l/assign2.html">assignment 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="cs35l/assign3.html">assignment 3</a></li>
</ol>
