        yknow i find it pretty cool<br/>
        when i first did this problem as a high school freshman<br/>
        i malded so hard it wasn't even funny<br/>
        had to read like 3 explanations and even then i was copying code without having any idea what it was doing
    </p>

    <p>
        and now i'm like, "yeah, this is just how it is" and solve it without looking at anything
    </p>

    <p>
        but anyways<br/>
        brute force suffices for p1<br/>
        but we're here for the much more interesting p2<br/>
        it just makes your deck STUPID big and also makes you go through the shuffle sequence a STUPID
        amount of times
    </p>

    <h2>starting off</h2>

    <p>
        how about let's try to come up with mathematical analogues for each of the shuffle operations?
        perhaps that'll let us simplify the shuffle sequence we're given here
    </p>

    <p>
        in all of these ops, here, say we have a card at position \(x\) in a deck of size \(d\)
        we number our positions \(0\) to \(\)
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>when we `deal into new stack`, our new position is \(d-x-1\)</li>
        <li>
            to `cut N` cards, we make our new position \(x-N \ (\mathrm{mod}\ d)\).
            this works even when \(N\) is negative, don't worry
        </li>
        <li>
            and finally to `deal with increment N`, our position gets turned into \(N \cdot x \ (\mathrm{mod}\ d)\).
            also quick note that \(d\) and \(N\) have to be coprime,
            otherwise you'd have two cards in the same position!
            (at least i think so lol)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        now, with these arithmetic operations, notice that all of them are just +/-/*<br/>
        so we can compress our <i>ENTIRE SHUFFLE SEQUENCE</i> into the form \(ax-b\ (\mathrm{mod}\ d)\)<br/>
        meaning that to get the position of a card initially at \(x\) after the shuffle, we just
        do one multiplication, one subtraction, and one modulus and we're done!
    </p>

    <h2>applying the loops</h2>

    <p>
        but we also have to go through the shuffle sequence itself like a stupid amount of times as well<br/>
        which amounts to applying \(f(x)=ax-b\ (\mathrm{mod}\ d)\) to \(x\) alot<br/>
        let's try to find a pattern here, maybe that'll help (the mod is removed for brevity reasons)
    </p>

    \[\begin{align}
    f(x)&=ax-b \\
    f(f(x))&=a^2x - ab - b \\
    f(f(f(x)))&=a^3x - a^2b - ab - b \\
    f(f(f(f(x))))&=a^4x - a^3b - a^2b - ab - b \\
    \end{align}\]

    <p>
        in general, if we apply the shuffle sequence \(n\) times,
        a card at position \(x\) ends up at the position given by the following expression:
    </p>

    \[a^nx - b(a^{n-1}+a^{n-2} + \cdots + a)\]

    <p>
        with the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Sum">formula for the sum of a geometric series</a>,
        we can then turn this into
    </p>

    \[x'=a^nx - b\frac{a^n-a}{a-1}\]

    <p>
        where \(x'\) is the new position of x
    </p>

    <h2>getting the card in the position</h2>

    <p>
        then you might be thinking,
        "my brother in christ it's not asking for where card `2020` went!
        it's asking for the card <i>in</i> position `2020`!"
    </p>

    <p>
        yeah. unfortunately we have to do a teensy bit more work,
        which is modifying the equation to give \(x\), the initial position, in terms of \(x'\), the final position<br/>
        doing that gives us this:
    </p>

    \[x=\frac{x'+b\frac{a^n-a}{a-1}}{a^n}\]

    <p>
        and that's our formula!
        note that since things are done mod \(d\), we have to compute some
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse">modular inverse</a>,
        but that's an implementation detail
