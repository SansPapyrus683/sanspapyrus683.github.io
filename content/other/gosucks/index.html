    <h1>ok go just SUCKS.</h1>

<div>
    <p>
        ok not even gonna start with a disclaimer here because i refuse to
        believe anyone unironically uses this abomination of a language
    </p>

    <p>
        i thought it would be a fun idea to finally finish aoc 2019
        (since i deleted all my old code for that year),
        and i also thought i should do it in a new language for a fun challenge
    </p>
    <p>
        since i had tried rust and hated it, i thought i should try go,
        a language people often compare it with for some reason
    </p>
    <p>
        and i believe that although rust sucks, go is <b>1000x WORSE.</b><br/>
        so let's get down into the weeds of it, shall we?
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        i didn't have any prejudices coming into this, no.<br/>
        <i>maybe</i> the fact that i was also learning vim at the same time had some impact
        <br/>
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/SansPapyrus683/a05edd9ac364d152b67d6219f2fa144e">
            <span class="small">here's my `.vimrc` if anyone cares</span>
        </a>
        <br/>
        but given that i had a positive experience with <i>vim</i>, i don't think so
    </p>

    <p>
        regardless, after doing 24 days (skipped 2019's day 22 bc of the large numbers involved),
        i've come to realize what go is.
    </p>
    <p>
        does anyone? remember the "kids mode" on certain applications that would shut down
        some functions of the device so kids couldn't do sussy stuff?<br/>
        <span class="small">i remember my parents put that on the ipad so i couldn't play games lol</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        that's go!<br/>
        the developers think we're too dumb to be trusted with any nice syntax sugar or features that have
        even the smallest percentage of a chance at being unsafe, so they just make go the most
        bare bones thing that it can possibly be.

    <h2>list of grievances (as always)</h2>

    <h3>no unused variables??</h3>

    <p>
        go and i got off on the wrong foot when it tried to pull <i>this</i> on me:
    </p>
    ```
    sanspapyrus683@kevin-laptop:~/GitHub/advent-of-code/y2019/go$ go run . <<< "2"
    # aoc2019
    ./day2.go:44:2: x declared and not used
    ```
    <p>
        i'm...sorry? is this a warning? if so, why is nothing else printing?
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="big"><b><i>NO.</i></b></span>
    </p>

    <p>
        turns out it's a godammned <b>ERROR</b>.<br/>
        the neckbearded linux emacs users over at google thought no code should have unused variables,
        so they made it so that code just...didn't compile.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>THERE ISN'T EVEN ANY CONSISTENCY WITH THIS RULE??!!</i></b><br/>
        unused vars and imports are errors, but unused function parameters and functions
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>way</b> too many times i've gotten the general layout of a program down and i want
        to run it to see if any RTEs happen only to be met with this stupid, godforsaken error.<br/>
    </p>

    <h3>no sets...</h3>
    <p>
        yeah.<br/>
        to get sets, you have to do this workaround:
    </p>
    ```go
    inbredSet := map[int]bool{1: true, 3: true}
    inbredSet[9] = true  // to add an element
    delete(inbredSet, 1)  // to delete an element
    ```
    <p>
        for a language that has its compiler autoinsert semicolons so it's "cleaner,"
        this sure as hell is not clean, go.
    </p>

    <h3>1984 brace style</h3>
    <p>
        oh! speaking of semicolons, did i mention that because of that semicolon insertion,
        golang actually doesn't allow if statements like this:
    </p>
    ```go
    x := 2
    if x == 2
    {
        fmt.Println("x is 2")
    }
    ```
    <p>
        i wasn't a fan of this brace style anyways, but people should be free to use it if they want to!
    </p>

    <h3>stupid naming conventions</h3>
    <p>
        did i mention the naming?
    </p>
    <p>
        in go, <i>everything</i>, even including constants, are named in camelCase.<br/>
        the only exception is public exported things, which are named with PascalCase.<br/>
        whose bright idea was that?
    </p>
    <p>
        when i'm typing an identifier, it's kinda helpful to know whether it's a variable/function, class, constant, or anything!
        <i>especially</i> in a language where functions can be passed around and assigned
    </p>

    <h3>weird assignment ops</h3>
    <p>
        also, what's with the two different assignment operators `:=` and `=`?<br/>
        why can't go just just handle variable scope normally like every other language?<br/>
        because of go's crap, i can't do this:
    </p>
    ```go
    type testStruct struct {
        a int
    }

    x := testStruct{2}
    x.a, b := funcThatReturnsTwoValues()  // this errors. need i say more?
    ```

    <h3>awful arrays</h3>
    <p>
        say you want to make a 2d array of 1's. should be a simple enough endeavour, right?<br/>
        well in GO, here's what you have to do
    </p>
    ```go
    stupidArr := make([][]int, 5)
    for i := 0; i < len(stupidArr); i++ {
        for j := 0; j < 7; j++ {
            stupidArr[i] = append(stupidArr[i], 1)
        }
    }
    ```
    <p>
        also, see that `append` function?<br/>
        you have to type in the array name TWICE to append it,
        so if you have a really long way to get to an array, well, good luck!
    </p>

    <h3>no ternary</h3>
    <p>
        even rust at least has some primitive form of "if condition then this value, else this value"<br/>
        so instead, i have to do this:
    </p>
    ```go
    var x int
    if condition {
        x = value1
    } else {
        x = value2
    }
    ```
    <p>
        congratulations, go.
        you've managed to turn one line of code into <b>SIX.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>no inline increments</h3>
    <p>
        ok this complaint isn't too big, but still.<br/>
        i see no reason why this is "unreadable" unless you're like just starting out in programming or something:
    </p>
    ```go
    arr[ind++] = val
    ```
    <p>
        bruh.
    </p>

    <h3>really, <i>really</i> empty stdlib</h3>
    <p>
        remember when i said there were no sets?
    </p>
    <p>
        well, turns out like a billion other data structures and stuff are lacking in this language<br/>
        i actually had to copy paste a
        <a href="https://github.com/SansPapyrus683/advent-of-code/blob/main/y2019/go/pq.go">priority queue implementation</a>
        FROM SCRATCH to implement dijkstra's algo!!
    </p>
    <p>
        at least there's regex, but that's cold comfort when even
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1085120/12128483">c conditionally has em</a>
    </p>

    <h3>no tuples or pairs or anything</h3>
    <p>
        yeah.
    </p>
    <p>
        if you want a map that holds two values, you have to slog through the creation
        of a whole new struct and then pass that struct to the map type.<br/>
        because of this, what could have been a simple
    </p>
    ```go
    x := make(map[int](int, string))
    ```
    <p>
        gets turned into
    </p>
    ```go
    type mapVal struct {
        a int
        b string
    }
    x := make(map[int]mapVal)
    ```
    <p>
        what the hell, man?
    </p>

    <h2>"conclusion"</h2>
    <p>
        i remember saying that rust was fine, it would just take some time for me to get used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        well, i'm NEVER getting used to this trash heap of a language.<br/>
        people joke that js was made in like 3 days or whatever, but THIS is the real 3-day-wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
        bye. god i'm burnt out.
