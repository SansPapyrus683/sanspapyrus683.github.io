<h1>assign 2</h1>

<p>
    don't you love it when you have to learn two programming languages for one assignment?
</p>

<h2>lisp (elisp, really)</h2>

<h3>`notes.txt` questions</h3>

<p>
    you can do some funny lisp playground stuff in emacs' `*scratch*` buffer,
    opened <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/23">like so</a>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        give an elisp expression/function that computes \(\left(2^{607-1}\right)\left(2^{607}-1\right)\)-
        you can do this with the `expt` function and friends
    </li>
    <li>
        then, write an expression that computes how many bits would be needed to store this number<br/>
        for example, you need 3 bits to represent 4, and 7 bits to represent 100<br/>
        you can do this with a log and ceiling function, should be quite straightforward
    </li>
    <li>what does `C-h k C-h k` do? why?</li>
    <li>what about `C-h k M-SPC`?</li>
    <li>
        go to the source code for the function `M-SPC` calls by going to its help page and
        pressing enter or clicking on the file source name<br/>
        the source for `M-SPC` should be implemented in terms of a more general function<br/>
        what's that general function? how can you call it?
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>"we have `what-line` at home" (main part)</h3>

<p>
    take a look at emacs' `what-line` command (run with `M-x what-line`) and notice that it outputs the current
    line number, but not how many lines are in the file total
</p>

<p>
    how about we fix that? make a file `gps-line.el` that contains a lisp function `what-line`
    that outputs the following
</p>
```
Line [x]/[n]
```
<p>
    where `[x]` should just be the line you're currently at and `[n]` is the total number of lines in the buffer<br/>
    visit `what-line`'s source code to see how it works!
</p>
<p>
    to count the total number of lines, you should just get the buffer and count the number of newline characters<br/>
    due to this specification, your function should be able to say things like `Line 1/0` when called on some text
    that doesn't end in a newline
</p>

<p>
    if you look at the source code for `what-line`, you'll see that there's some special logic for "narrowed buffers"
    or whatever the hell<br/>
    i would recommend implementing support for that just in case, since the code is pretty copy and paste-able for that
</p>

<p>
    you should be able to load the file and the function within by typing `M-:` (really `M-shift-;`) and running this:
    ```lisp
    (require "gps-line.el")
    ```
    or you can follow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6401163/12128483">this guide</a> to load it in on startup
</p>

<h2>python</h2>

<p>
    honestly wonder what proportion of a 35l class knows python already
</p>

<p>
    but anyways there's three versions of python on the seasnet servers that are of relevance to this part<br/>
    any questions that require running code or whatever, i'd recommend you do them on there
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        `/usr/local/cs/bin/python3`, python 3.11, invoked when you do `python3` given that you followed
        the initial setup instructions in <a href="assign1.html">assignment 1</a> correctly
    </li>
    <li>`/usr/bin/python3`, an earlier version of python3</li>
    <li>`python2`, python 2 WHICH LITERALLY ISN'T SUPPORTED ANYMORE WHY ARE WE STILL BEING EDUCATED ON THIS</li>
</ul>

<h3>`notes.txt` questions part 1</h3>

<p>
    consider the following script
    <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter24/cs35L/assign/randline.py">randline</a>
    <b>(WINTER 24 VERSION, MAY BE OUTDATED)</b>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        what happens when you run this and why?
        ```bash
        ./randline.py /dev/null  # or any other empty file
        ```
    </li>
    <li>
        this script is built for python 2- what happens when it's run with python 3? like this:
        ```bash
        python3 randline.py
        ```
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>main part</h3>

<p>
    code up a python 3 script `shuf.py` that mimics the default `shuf` command<br/>
    it should implement the following options:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>`-n`/`--head-count`, which specifies the number of lines of output</li>
    <li>`-e`/`--echo`, which specifies treats the given arguments (except flags) as the lines to shuffle</li>
    <li>`-r`/`--repeat`, which when specified allows for a single line to be outputted twice</li>
    <li>`--help`, which you shouldn't worry about because `argparse` should generate one for you</li>
</ul>
<p>
    these descriptions aren't comprehensive-
    consult the man pages or just run it yourself to see how things actually work
</p>

<!-- TODO: PUT SOME TEST CASES --->

<p>
    as of winter 24, you can only import from `argparse`, `string`,
    and the non-`optparse` modules already imported in the `randline` script
</p>

<h3>`notes.txt` questions part 2</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        what happens when your script is invoked with python 2 instead of python 3?
    </li>
    <li>
        according to python, 3.11 is significantly faster than older versions; let's test it out!
        time your shuf script like so:
        ```bash
        time [executable] < /usr/share/unicode/ucd/BidiTest.txt > /dev/null
        ```
        where `[executable]` can be one of three things:
        <ul>
            <li>`shuf` (just default lol)</li>
            <li>`/usr/local/cs/bin/python3 shuf.py` (python 3.11)</li>
            <li>`/usr/bin/python3` (some version before python 3.11)</li>
        </ul>

        for each command, time it three times, and report the median of the sum of the user & system times<br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        well? is 3.11 faster? if your program can't run on the given pre-3.11 version, explain why<br/>
        also document the cpu model and os this crap was run on by
        running `lscpu` and looking at `/etc/os-release` respectively
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>what to turn in</h2>

<ul>
    <li>`gps-line.el`, with a function `what-line` that performs as specified</li>
    <li>`shuf.py`</li>
    <li>`notes.txt`, with the answers to the questions specified above</li>
</ul>
