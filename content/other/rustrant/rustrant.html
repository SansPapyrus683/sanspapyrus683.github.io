    <h1>rust is a language</h1>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        obviously just my opinion, please don't dox me
    </p>

    <p>
        over the summer i got into rust<br/>
        not of my own volition, but because my friends said it was a great tool for building CLIs<br/>
        and i was thinking of building a CLI for automatically running, checking, and diffing
        usaco + cf solutions<br/>
        so like an absolute buffoon, i went along with it for whatever reason<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        the very next day, they just disappeared and left me,
        the only one without any prior rust experience, to rot in backlog hell<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        "well piss", i thought, "but frick it, i made a goddamned commitment and i'm going to do this"
    </p>
    <p>
        what a mistake that was
    </p>
    <img src="crustymf.png" alt="the bane of my existence" class="half-img"/>
    <p>
        <i>god, i hate this cheeky little crab with a vengeance</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        rust starts out pretty fine, actually<br/>
        (btw if anyone's curious i learned it from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book">here</a>)
    </p>
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        println!("hello world!");
    }
    ```
    <p>
        alright, the exclamation mark seems a bit weird, but other than that it's just a standard language right?<br/>
        <small>right?</small>
    </p>

    <p>
        but anyways, rust does has some pretty neat qol stuff, like:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>no parenthesis for control flow statements</li>
        <li>builtin nice tuple support (ahem, c++, <i><b>ahem</b></i>)</li>
        <li>sick range syntax with inclusivity/exclusivity</li>
        <li>dynamic type inference with some exceptions,
            but still it's really good for a statically typed langauge like rust</li>
    </ol>
    ```rust
    for i in 1..=10 {
        let nice_tuple = (1, 'c');
        let x = nice_tuple.0;
        let y = nice_tuple.1;
    }
    ```
    <p>
        yeah, pretty cool!
    </p>

    <p>
        but <i>just</i> as you think it's all fine & dandy, and think you're ready
        to take on functions:
    </p>
    ```rust
    fn bruh_moment(x: String) {
        let y = x;
    }

    fn main() {
        let x = "bro...".to_string();  //  <- also very stupid
        bruh_moment(x);
        dbg!(x);
    }
    ```

    <p>
        rust just punches you in the face with THIS:
    </p>
    ```rust
    error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
    --> src/main.rs:8:10
      |
    6 |     let x = "bro...".to_string();
      |         - move occurs because `x` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
    7 |     bruh_moment(x);
      |                 - value moved here
    8 |     dbg!(x);
      |          ^ value used here after move

    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.
    ```

    <p>
        <b><i>WHAT THE HECK??</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
        TURNS OUT, if you just define a raw type (other than primitives), the function TAKES OWNERSHIP
        of the value and you just CAN'T USE IT AGAIN
    </p>
    <p>
        but at least in this sample code snippet, you can fix it by doing this:
    </p>
    ```rust
    fn bruh_moment(x: &String) {
        let y = x;
    }

    fn main() {
        let x = "bro...".to_string();
        bruh_moment(&x);
        dbg!(x);
    }
    ```

    <p>
        thus embodies the essence of rust:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        it's memory safe, but at what cost?
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        anyways, i decided to practice rust by redoing advent of code 2015, which i'd previously done in python <br/>
        (you can find the src
        <a href="https://github.com/SansPapyrus683/advent-of-code/tree/main/y2015/src/bin">here</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
        and thus began a series of interactions with the rust compiler which mostly went like this:
    </p>
    <img src="bateman.jpg" alt="american psycho" class="half-img"/>

    <p>
        and i feel like that took away half my sanity
    </p>

    <p>
        it's not just the ownership system- even simple stuff like converting
        to an integer is kinda convoluted
    </p>
    ```rust
    let i = "1".parse::&lt;i32&gt;().unwrap();  // bruh just give us a global function or something
    ```

    <p>
        in fact, i've had so many problems with rust's "i'm not like other languages" style
        that i've compiled a list of grievances (very long!!!)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            sometimes you're casually chaining a function and then this happens
            ```rust
            error[E0716]: temporary value dropped while borrowed
            --> src\bin\day1.rs:4:18
            |
            4 |     let digits = fs::read_to_string("input/day1.txt").expect("you done messed up").trim();
            |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       - temporary value is freed at the end of this statement
            |                  |
            |                  creates a temporary which is freed while still in use
            ...
            7 |     for d in digits.trim().chars() {
            |              ------------- borrow later used here
            |
            = note: consider using a `let` binding to create a longer lived value
            ```
            for a language that does have a ton of functional programming features,
            this is a problem, to say the least
        </li>
        <li>
            this is where rust's "no implicit conversion EVER" gets you
            ```rust
            error[E0369]: cannot subtract `char` from `char`
            --> src\bin\day1.rs:13:35
            |
            13 |             total += digit_vec[i] - '0';
            |                      ------------ ^ --- char
            |                      |
            |                      char
            ```
            you could've just given an RTE for overflow, yknow? <br/>
            <br/>
            even worst is when you have to do stuff like this
            ```rust
            (n - 4 * k.pow(2) - 3 * k, k)
            ```
            in this segment, `n` and `k` are `u32`'s, and you have to return an `i32` <br/>
            yeah.... you have to cast the numbers EVERY DAMN TIME YOU USE THEM
        </li>
        <li>
            rust's string system by itself is loony as all frick <br/>
            `String`, `&str`, `&String`, `OsStr`, why the PISS are there so many types <br/>
            and especially indexing <br/>
            they have an `.nth()` function, but that takes linear time <br/>
            why is it that basically EVERY OTHER LANGUAGE can do constant time string indexing but rust????
        </li>
        <li>
            sometimes rust's type inference system just has a stroke for no reason at all
            ```rust
            let nums: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = row.split_whitespace()
                .map(|n| n.parse::&lt;i32&gt;().unwrap_or(0))
                .collect();
            ```
            WHY ARE THE TYPE ANNOTATIONS NEEDED? <br/>
            WHAT POSSIBLE AMBIGUITY COULD THERE BE?
        </li>
        <li>
            ```rust
            let ring = (SQUARE_ID as f32).sqrt() as u32;
            ```
            i can't believe you have to do this just to get the floor of a square root
        </li>
        <li>
            why can arrays have `i32` or `usize` as indices BUT NOT `Vec`s?
        </li>
        <li>
            this is where no good ternary expression and no conversion gets you.
            ```rust
            ring -= if ring % 2 == 0 { 1 } else { 0 };
            ```
            *slow clap*
        </li>
        <li>
            why is there the `&` token AND the `.as_ref()` function?
        </li>
        <li>
            ```rust
            error[E0597]: `occs` does not live long enough
            --> src\bin\day4.rs:30:21
            |
            27 |         if seen.contains(&occs) {
            |            -------------------- borrow later used here
            ...
            30 |         seen.insert(&occs);
            |                     ^^^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
            31 |     }
            |     - `occs` dropped here while still borrowed
            ```
            then. <br/>
            just. <br/>
            have it live long enough? <br/>
            idk rust, this seems like a you problem
        </li>
        <li>
            for some godforsaken reason you can't use external variables/generic types
            in sub functions even though all the other languages that have nested functions support it
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="bloat.png" alt="bloat" class="half-img"/> <br/>
            who on god's green earth thought these functions were a good idea
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        anyways, my main problem with rust is the sheer anxiety it gives you through how many things
        it makes you consider when writing your code
    </p>
    <p>
        actually i wouldn't say <i>problem</i>, more like just it's different,
        and it's gonna take a hell of a long time for me to get used to it.
