<h2>chi-square test for goodness of fit</h2>

<p>
    this test is used to compare categorical distributions and see how
    likely it is you got one by sampling from the other
</p>

<h3>hypotheses</h3>

<p>
    \(H_0\): the claimed distr [ctx] is true<br/>
    \(H_a\): the claimed distr [ctx] <i>isn't</i> true
</p>

<h3>conditions</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>rng</b></li>
    <li><b>10%:</b> sum of all instances (in the harvard wksht it was 2023 total admits)</li>
    <li><b>large counts:</b> expected counts of all categories is at least 5!! not 10, 5!!!</li>
</ul>

<h3>formula</h3>

\[\chi^2=\sum \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}\]

<p>
    here, O is the observed value & E is the expected value for each category<br/>
    then use chi squared cdf on your calculator w/ df = (# of categories) - 1
    to get the final p-value
</p>

<h3>pic</h3>

<p>
    here's what shit looks like
</p>

<img class="center half-img" src="img/packet14/chi_squared.png" alt="pic of the chi squared distr"/>

<p>
    lime green area is what you shade & calculate the area of to get the p-value
</p>

<p>
    be sure to indicate the df<br/>
    personally i also like to indicate where 0 is, but who knows
</p>

<h2>chi-square test for homo</h2>

<h3>hypotheses</h3>

<p>
    \(H_0\): there's no diff in the [categorical var] distr between [pop 1] & [pop 2]<br/>
    \(H_a\): there <i>is</i> a diff in yeah yeah we fucking get it
</p>

<p>
    conditions are basically the same,
    just a couple of things that make this different from the last one
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        expected counts for each cell =
        \(\text{sample total} \cdot \frac{\text{category total}}{\text{total total}}\)
    </li>
    <li>\(\text{df}=(\text{# of cat vars} - 1)(\text{# of samples} - 1)\)</li>
    <li>this one is 2 samples 1 var, the last one was 1 sample 1 var</li>
</ul>

<h2>chi-square test for independence</h2>

<h3>hypotheses</h3>

<p>
    \(H_0\): there <i>isn't</i> an assoc. between var 1 & var 2
    \(H_a\): there is one
</p>

<h3>what the fuck is the difference between all these tests</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>gof:</b> 1 sample, 1 var, testing if a claimed distribution actually works</li>
    <li><b>homo:</b> 2+ samples, 1 var, testing if being in a diff sample makes any diff</li>
    <li><b>indep:</b> 1 sample, 2 vars, testing if across the same sample shit's related</li>
</ul>
