        i'm back!!!11!!
    </p>

    <p>
        and this time i'm not gonna do some cf problem, it's actually going to one from codewars
    </p>

    <p>
        the problem itself is actually kinda simple
        <br>
        it gives you n, and asks you to find the element at the ith index in a sorted list of all balanced parenthesis
        <br>
        so like if n was 3, the list would be this:
    </p>
    ```py
    ["((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"]
    ```

    <p>
        and you have to find whatever element at whatever position it asks you to find
    </p>

    <p>
        i was stuck on this problem for like 2 whole days then i realized it was way simpler than i thought
    </p>

    <p>
        so let's build the parenthesis one by one, using
        <code class="language-py">bal_parens(3, 2)</code> as an example
        <br>
        we start with an empty string with an opening parenthesis (since it has to start w/ one):
    </p>

    ```py
    '('
    ```

    <p>
        now, how do we know whether we should add a `)` or another `(`?
    </p>
    <p>
        well, notice that if we add a `)`, we've limited ourselves to only being able to
        make the last 2 elements of the list
        <br>
        (remember that the list is sorted in alphabetical order, so we can make this assumption)
        <br>
        we want the 3rd element, so it's obvious why we can't add a `)`- we have to add a `(`
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>NOTE!</b> that if we had wanted the second half of the list, we'd have to subtract
        3 (the size of the first half) from our target index to maintain the accuracy of the value
    </p>

    <p>
        now onto the next choice- another `(` or a `)`?
        <br>
        we do the calculations again
        <br>
        do we want the first element, or the last 2 elements?
        <br>
        we def want the last 2, so let's go with those, subtracting 1 from our index
    </p>

    <p>
        and continuing this calculation, we end up with `(()())`, which is the correct answer
    </p>

    <p>
        now we just need a way to quickly compute how many ways there are to compute the # of ways to complete a set of
        parenthesis given the # of opening parenthesis and the # of closing parenthesis
        <br>
        it's a good thing this can be doable with simple dp-
        <br>
        let <code class="language-py">complete_ways[o][c]</code> be the # of ways to complete a par string
        given `o` opening & `c` closing parenthesis
    </p>

    <p>
        this would be the table if the total # of parentheses was 3
    </p>
    ```py
    [[5, 0, 0, 0],
     [5, 2, 0, 0],
     [3, 2, 1, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1]]
    ```

    <p>
        we have a base case of complete_ways[par_amt][par_amt] = 1, and the recursion relation is p simple as well:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-py">complete_ways[o][c] = complete_ways[o + 1][c] + complete_ways[o][c + 1]</code></pre>

    <p>
        (given that the previous indices are defined, of course)
    </p>

    <p>
        but without further ado, here's my code:
    </p>
</div>

<script src="../../inline_code.js"></script>

<script src="../../init.js"></script>
<script>
    ARGS.init({"file": "sol.py"});
</script>
<script src="../../load_code.js"></script>

<div id="code"></div>
