<h1>genuinely the worst flight i've gone through</h1>

<div style="color: greenyellow">
    ```
    > be me
    > flying back from shanghai
    > like 11 hours or so, can't be that bad
    > after i get through security feel the symptoms of a cold
    > oh no.jpg

    > eh whatever i'll rest on the plane surely
    > go on plane, sleep for 2 hours, sure
    > wake up to awful back pain
    > i stand up, take walks, it does NOT go away
    > i see an empty aisle at the head of the cabin
    > screw it, my back is worth more than my dignity
    > lie down there before a flight attendant notices me and says "hey you can't do that"
    > well it was fun while it lasted
    > go back to seat, feeling like i'm boutta die
    > want to go to sleep
    > but the backpain prevents me from relaxing in any manner
    > incredible

    > get up to go to the bathroom
    > see that some lavatories have a considerable amount of floor space
    > "anon don't do it", i tell myself
    > after a couple hours the pain gets way too fucking much to bear

    > i throw away what's left of my sanity
    > begrudgingly get some sheets of paper towels
    > wipe the floor as much as i can
    > lie down in like a kind of rotated sitting position
    > back on the floor, legs & feet on the toilet lid
    > it's the only thing that makes me feel better
    > sigh
