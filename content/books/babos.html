<h1>preamble</h1>

<p>
    so i've started trying to get back into reading, like, actual books
</p>

<p>
    i was scrolling on nyt, seeing if there were any good comment sections to eat popcorn to, when i came across
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/opinion/columbia-core.html">this lil column</a>
    by our favorite conservative columnist ross douthat
</p>

<p>
    i'm not going to get into how good <i>his</i> takes are, but what i am going to say is that i looked
    at his reading list and my brain was like, "it <i>has</i> been a hot minute since you've read..."
</p>

<p>
    and here i am
</p>

<p>
    think it'd be a waste of reading if i didn't at least make something out of it, so here i am,
    writing this blog post that probably no one will read
</p>

<h1>ok actual comments</h1>

    there's so many quotes that are just hilarious when taken out of context

        Forty years ago grandees could still hang the pelts of the wild animals they had killed upon their walls. In

        yeah no i asked all my friends and they, including me, were like
        "this would just make me respect the person, not hate them"
    </p>
    <p>
        in fact i was staying at an alaska airbnb with my family over summer and the owner
        had this pelt of a bear that her son had supposedly killed.
        when i was told that, i was just like "damn, must be a cool son you have"

    gonna try to use proper grammar on this one<br/>

<p>
    i'm not even expecting any coherent thoughts to come out of this,
    since i'm a cs major and thus am not cut out for this kind of writing
</p>

<h3>i hate business majors</h3>

<p>
    In <i>Bobos in Paradise</i>, David Brooks describes the supposed fusion
    of what he describes as the "bohemians" and the "bourgeoisie" classes of America in the 1950s.
    According to him, the "bohemians" were people like Ernest Hemingway who disregarded material gain
    for the sake of intellectual pursuits.
    They wrote books for their small audience, and didn't live very comfortably.
    The bourgeoisie, on the other hand, lived boring but luxurious lives and were mostly occupied
    with their own material gain.
    According to Brooks, these two classes have fused into what he calls the "bobo" class,
    short for "bo"hemian "bo"urgeoisie.
    However, I believe a better description of this new class would be "babos".
    That is, "ba"stardized "bo"hemians.
</p>

<p>
    In a chapter about these bobos and business, Brooks argues for the existence of a new "countercultural capitalism"
    among all these bobos:
</p>
<blockquote>
    [T]he people who talk most relentlessly about smashing the status quo and crushing the establishment are management
    gurus and corporate executives.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Honestly, I don't know if Brooks thinks these execs legitimately are rebels trying to break the "big guys," because
    they sure as hell aren't.
    It's just the language they have to speak to get us consumers to obediently buy whatever stupid new product they're
    pushing
    that probably doesn't even work as well as the deprecated version they previously sold.
    Those LinkedIn lunatics lure you in with talk about how they're with the little guy, only to hit you right in the
    wallet with whatever new offer they came up with.
    Or perhaps I'm just thinking this way because I've spent too much time on Tumblr.
    Who knows?
</p>

<p>
    Like any good conservative writer, Brooks also finds time to romanticize the grind.
    According to him, the bobos have created a new work ethic that's even more extensive
    than the Protestant one that most people talk about.
</p>
<blockquote>
    [Countercultural capitalists] have constructed their own ethos that creates a similar
    and perhaps more rigorous system of restraint.
    They have transformed work into a spiritual and intellectual vocation
</blockquote>
<p>
    Despite his best efforts to glorify this new ethos, I can't help but think that it's a bit crazy.
    Even though I myself really, <i>really</i> like grinding coding and wouldn't mind doing it as work for
    the rest of my life (as long as I have the intellectual capacity to),
    I know that not everyone thinks work should be the centerpiece of their life.
    In fact, having it be so just seems sad and messed up.
    I'm willing to bet that a hefty chunk of the American populace doesn't see work as anything "fun"
    or something to enjoy doing, but simply as a means of income.
    If you ask them whether they find spiritual meaning in their work, they'd probably laugh in your face.
    What meaning would an Amazon warehouse worker or a McDonalds cashier find in their working lives?
</p>

<p>
    But then again, this same chunk probably isn't at the top of the economic ladder.
    Perhaps the reason this upper class finds this purported "spiritual and intellectual vocation" in their work
    only because they're the head honcho.
    They're the only ones that get to make important decisions and actually make an impact,
    no matter it positive or negative, on their company and the world around it.
</p>

<p>
    Overall, I fail to see any kind of truly rebellious thought in the people and work ethic Brooks describes.
    These babos have taken what used to be the genuinely rebellious thoughts of the Beat generation
    and whatnot and somehow managed to twist them back into being a emphasizing being a good capitalist cog.
    Brooks states that
</p>
<blockquote>
    [Business trendsetters have] simply gone out and tried to create a different kind of businessperson,
    one more in keeping with bohemian values.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Reading this, I take a look at the businesspeople surrounding me today and see people like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.
    Are these people really the "bohemian bourgeoisie" Brooks describes?
    One underpays his workers so much they might as well be working in the coal mines back in England,
    while the other is trying to reestablish the concept of a goddamned company town and has
    a product line with <i>awful</i> safety regulations.
    How are these people any more different than the robber barons of the past like Vanderbilt and Carnegie?
    Those people did essentially the same thing, building empires on the backs of underpaid workers,
    but at least they did one or two good things in their lifetime, like establishing
    cool universities like Stanford or CMU.
    Of course, maybe we'll have a Bezos University or Gates University in the near future,
    but given the current trajectory of billionaires I find it unlikely.
    Both Bezos and Musk are currently hyperfixated with the fantasy of going to space,
    an obsession that probably doesn't leave much room for philanthropy.
</p>

<h3>what about the other parts of the book?</h3>

<p>
    Of course, all these thoughts are in just one chapter of Brooks's book.
    Deification of that bastard Kissinger otherwise, I found much of the book pretty insightful and oftentimes funny.
    Brooks includes a lot of first-person narration about his experiences in the new affluent bobo towns
    like Wayne, Pennsylvania or Winnetka, Illinois.
</p>

<p>
    When he made a lengthy satire describing what an intellectual in this day and age is supposed to do, though,
    I failed to understand what his actual point was.
    He spent the entire chapter throwing criticism after criticism at how current intellectual life is
    in the US, but right at the end of the chapter he talks about its virtues.
    Im not sure if this was just meant to be a description of what current intellectual life is,
    in which case he definitely succeeds.
    But if Brooks was trying to make a definite argument, it certainly was lost on my illiterate self.
</p>

<p>
    The chapter about pleasure was really one of the most enjoyable things I've read in a long time, though.
    It starts off strong with a description of a BDSM convention, and then goes on to talk about vacations.
    In the middle of this chapter, though, Brooks drops this quote:
</p>
<blockquote>
    In humor, for example, we have become tolerant of sexual jokes over the past 30 years but extremely
    intolerant of ethnic jokes. We have become far more relaxed about things like posture and proper attire
    but far more restrictive about anger, spitting, and smoking.
    We have become more tolerant about frank sexual talk in public but more censorious about lewd banter
    or any talk that could be interpreted as harassment.
</blockquote>
<p>
    While a part of me goes, "yeah, <i>obviously</i> racist jokes aren't allowed!"
    another smaller part of me goes "but why?
    These 'sexual jokes' Brooks speaks of could have just as much potential to offend given the culture, no?"
    It's a messed up thing for part of me to think, but food for thought, you know?
</p>

<p>
    BSDM and racist jokes aside, Brooks really gets really sarcastic when he talks about vacations.
    With sarcasm that's thick enough to concuss a person with, he describes how people now have to take
    "productive" vacations that result in self-reflection, whether it be a hike through the Himalayas,
    or building houses in the Amazon.
    He uses his words with such force that it makes you wonder what these house-builders and hikers
    ever did to him.
    Perhaps Brooks never had to endure racist jokes or generally terrible political takes
    from an uncle over Thanksgiving dinner or something.
    Without contest, those are infinitely worse than hearing some cracked guy brag about how
    he went whitewater rafting in the Grand Canyon.
    Sure, he might be bragging, but at least it's about a non-touchy subject.
</p>

<p>
    <b>final rating or something: 8/10</b>,
    -2 points for glorifying the grind and businessmen, everything else is great though
