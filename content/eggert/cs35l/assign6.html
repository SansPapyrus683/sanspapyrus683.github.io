<h1>assign 6</h1>

<p>
    take this
    <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter24/cs35L/assign/randall-git.tgz">tarball</a>
    (MAY BE DIFF FOR YOUR QUARTER), download and extract it, you know the deal<br/>
    everything you work on will be in this repo so that's cool
</p>
<p>
    the spec says to not put your repo on github but honestly a private repo is fine,
    it's not like anyone's gonna notice anyways (since your repo is literally private)
</p>

<p>
    now you'll notice that it just consists of a `.git` directory.
    that's expected!
    just do this to actually get the working tree up and running:
    ```bash
    git reset --hard
    ```
</p>

<p>
    to compile the program, just run a quick
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    and you should see a magical executable `randall` file popup!
</p>

<h2>notes...</h2>

<p>
    before i get into the assignment, unfortunately you have to do
    THAT STUPID LAB NOTEBOOK, EVEN THOUGH THE TAS PROBABLY SPEND LIKE 30 SECONDS JUST GLOSSING OVER IT<br/>
    yeah put that in a file `notes.txt`
</p>
<p>
    ah what the hell, i'll put another part from my notes in here
</p>
<details>
    <summary>`notes.txt` excerpt</summary>
    <p>
        cloned the repository for the template code n stuff
    </p>

    <p>
        tried some debug `printfs`
        turns out at the end past `fclose(stdout)` nothing gets printed for obvious reasons
    </p>

    <p>
        for some godforsaken reason make uses the `/bin/sh` and not bash
        had to set `SHELL = /bin/bash` for things to work
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>MOVING FILES</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        moved all functions to their relevant places, added header guards and such
        had to modify the makefile to compile `*.c` instead of just `$@.c`
    </p>

    <p>
        in `options.h`, put the option parsing into a function called `parse_nbytes`
    </p>

    <p>
        everything in the code still worked as expected
    </p>
</details>

<h2>refactoring</h2>

<p>
    split the code in `randall.c` up into a couple of blocks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>`options.c`/`options.h` has functions for option parsing and whatever</li>
    <li>`output.c`/`output.h` should contain the code that outputs stuff</li>
    <li>
        `rand64-hw.c`/`rand64-hw.h` contains code that does the hardware-based rng
        (the rng that's implemented by default i think?)
    </li>
    <li>
        `rand64-sw.c`/`rand64-sw.h` contains the code for sw-based rng,
        which currently just reads from `/dev/random`
    </li>
    <li>and finally, `randall.c` should contain the code that glues everything together</li>
</ul>

<h2>new features</h2>

<p>new features are implemented by way of 2 new options you pass</p>

<p>
    if you're wondering how the hell you implement parsing options, check out
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Example-of-Getopt.html">`getopt`</a>
</p>

<h3>`-i` options</h3>

<p>
    this option should take 3 classes of values
</p>

<ol>
    <li>`rdrand` is the default option, and it should call the rng that was already impl'd in what was given</li>
    <li>`lrand48_r` should instead generate rng w/ `lrand48_r`</li>
    <li>
        `/F`, where `/F` is the path to some random file.
        in this case, you should just read byte by byte from the file haha<br/>
        don't worry about handling reading past the end, the TAs didn't test for that
        (at least in my quarter)
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    now i searched the entire goddamn internet and found NO tutorial on how to use this
    stupid goddamned `lrand48_r` function,
    so here's the code example that i made with some help from gpt
    ```c
    // put this in a file-wide declaration or smth idk
    static struct drand48_data rand_data;

    // when you initialize it
    srand48_r(time(NULL), &rand_data);

    // when you call it
    long int tmp1, tmp2;
    mrand48_r(&rand_data, &tmp1);
    mrand48_r(&rand_data, &tmp2);
    /* mrand48 only gives 32-bit ints, so we combine them for 1 64-bit one */
    unsigned long long x = (((unsigned long long) tmp1) << 32) + (unsigned long long)tmp2;
    ```
    haha you might be thinking "hey, why are you using `mrand48_r`?"<br/>
    to that i'll just let the goat benson liu explain:
</p>
<details>
    <summary>awesome explanation</summary>
    <p>
        In the specifications for Assignment 6,
        it asks you to implement an option for using `lrand48_r` and using that specific function.
        However, this function is a bit confusing to use.
        A detailed explanation is included below.
        For this assignment, while still implementing the `lrand48_r` option
        we recommend using the `mrand48` function instead which has been okayed.
        You are still allowed to use the original function
        but check the explanation below for why this is a bit confusing and be careful.
        A quick hint for all students is to note that `mrand48` returns 32 bits of random data whereas the data type of
        the `rand64` function is `unsigned long long` which has 64 bits of random data so you will need to call
        the function twice to full create 64 bits of random data.
        You will need to use some bit manipulation to try and complete this part of the assignment.
    </p>

    <p>
        [he says eggert may ask about either one but none appeared on my final haha]
    </p>

    <p>
        So be prepared and read the explanation below. ðŸ˜ƒ
    </p>
    <p>
        Explanation: `lrand48_r`, if you read the provided documentation, actually only returns 31 bits of random data
        (i.e. the return value range is only from 0 to \(2^{31}\) if you check the documentation despite the
        return data type being `long int`).
        This is extremely confusing to use because in order to pad out the full 64 bits of random data,
        you potentially need to call `lrand48_r` three times in order to have enough random bits.
        `mrand48` is more intuitive.
        This returns 32 bits of random data which you can call twice to get 64 bits of random data.
    </p>
   <p>
       A bit of a hint of the bit manipulation.
       Because you have two 32 bit numbers, you need a way to shift one of those numbers to
       the upper 32 bits of an unsigned long long and OR that with another 32-bit number that is used as the lower bits.
   </p>

    <p>
        A specific reference to the documentation about this is included
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/SVID-Random.html#index-lrand48">here</a>.
    </p>
</details>

<h3>`-o` options</h3>

<p>
    alright now you also have this option, which takes just 2 classes of values
</p>

<ol>
    <li>`stdio`, which is the default (but slow as heck) `putchar` behavior- passed in by default</li>
    <li>
        `N`, where `N` is some positive integer<br/>
        in that case, output blocks `N` bytes at a time using the `write` syscall
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    like with `lrand48_r`, <b>NO</b> guide was given on how the hell you do that `N` option,
    so i'll give a quick general example on how you might do it
    ```c
    char* buf = malloc(sizeof(char) * N);
    // pretend i filled buf up with some tasty random bytes

    /*
     * 1 is the file descriptor (stdout)
     * buf represents the characters we have to write out
     * N is how many we actually wanna write out
     * the function returns the number of bytes successfully written
     */
    int written = write(1, buf, N);

    free(buf);  // o yea make sure to do this to prevent any stupid memory leaks
    ```
</p>

<h2>testing</h2>

<p>
    now go to that `Makefile` thing you see in your project directory<br/>
    add a new target `check` that goes something like this:
    ```makefile
    check: clean randall
    	# insert awesome testing script here
    	@echo "test passed";
    ```
    once again, we weren't taught jack about how the hell you actually write these tests, so
    i'll include a pretty simple one here:
    ```makefile
    @cmd="./randall 10"; \
    output=$$(eval $${cmd} | wc -c); \
    diff <(echo $${output}) <(echo "10") >/dev/null || \
        (echo "$${cmd} should output 10 bytes, got $${output} instead" && exit 1);
    @echo "test 1 passed";
    ```
</p>

<p>
    eggert wants you to test a couple more, i have 6 in my makefile
</p>

<p>
    something i suggest doing if you're like me and hate giant blocks of code is to split
    up the tests into separate targets like `test1`, `test2`, etc. and then do this:
    ```makefile
    check: clean randall test1 test2 test3  # ...
    ```
</p>

<p>
    on an unrelated note, it's also cool to check for memory leaks<br/>
    you can do this by installing `valgrind` and doing this:
    ```bash
    valgrind ./randall [args]
    ```
    if you're on linux you can just like `dnf install` or `apt install` it,
    for macos and windows you're on your own haha<br/>
    worst case seasnet exists
</p>

<h2>timing stuff?</h2>

<p>
    alright when you're done with this stupid randall script,
    experiment with what options make it go zoom zoom<br/>
    this command here should be a sorta baseline, but dw if your impl is slower than it:
    ```bash
    time dd if=/dev/urandom ibs=8192 obs=8192 count=16384 >/dev/null
    ```
</p>
<p>
    i guess he also wants you to report the results of these 3 `time` commands in `notes.txt` as well:
    ```bash
    time ./randall 133562368 >/dev/null
    time ./randall 133562368 | cat >/dev/null
    time ./randall 133562368 >rand.data
    ```
</p>
<p>
    these should be (at least for me they were) hella slow, so try messing around
    with various options (i found the `-o N` option resulted in the greatest speed increases for me)
</p>

<h2>what to turn in</h2>

<p>
    ok first make sure all the lines in your project are valid at least according to eggert with this command:
    ```bash
    # this should output nothing
    expand Makefile notes.txt *.c *.h |
      awk '/\r/ || 100 < length'
    ```
</p>

<p>
    now also go to the variable `assignment-files`
    and add all the new files you added, so it might go smth like:
    ```makefile
    assignment-files = COPYING Makefile randall.c \
      notes.txt options.h options.c output.h output.c \
      rand64-hw.h rand64-hw.c rand64-sw.h rand64-sw.c
    ```
    this makes sure that makefile actually zips all your files when you run the makefile targets
</p>

<p>
    alright so what makefile targets am i talking about?
    these two:
    ```bash
    make submission-tarball repository-tarball
    ```
    now you should see two new files: `randall-submission.tgz` and `randall-git.tgz`<br/>
    turn those in and you're chilling
