        this isn't gonna be a normal editorial<br/>
        my cs teacher assigned us to write a blog post<br/>
        and in a pure coincendence, i've just been developing this blog site<br/>
        so might as well write it here
    </p>

    <p>
        so.<br/>
        tower of hanoi.<br/>
        too lazy to explain it, so here's the description copied right from the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">wikipedia page</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        The Tower of Hanoi [...] is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of
        various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order
        of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape.
        The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following rules:

        <ol>
            <li>Only one disk may be moved at a time.</li>
            <li>
                Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and
                placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
            </li>
            <li>No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.</li>
        </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        so yeah i just have to make a solver for this (in java bc it's ap cs)
    </p>
    <p>
        it's a good thing my wonderful cs teacher mr. jan gave a really good hint<br/>
        first, let's just define the disks as A, B, and C (with all the disks starting on A)<br/>
        second, we just have a move be `X -> Y`, where we move a disk from X to Y<br/>
        now let's list out some simple solutions for 1 disk to 4 disks
    </p>

            <summary>2 disks</summary>

            <summary>3 disks</summary>
            ```

        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>4 disks</summary>
            ```
            A -> B
            A -> C
            B -> C
            A -> B
            C -> A
            C -> B
            A -> B
            A -> C
            B -> C
            B -> A
            C -> A
            B -> C
            A -> B
            A -> C
            B -> C
            ```

    </div>

    <p>
        it's a bit hard to notice, but there are three key observations to make here:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>for `n` disks, there's \(2^n-1\) moves ALWAYS.</li>
        <li>the middle move is always `A -> C`</li>
        <li>
            this is the big one: the top half & bottom half of each solution is a transformation
            of the previous solution
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        what do i mean by the third point? well, if you squint real hard, you can see that the top
        part of each solution (the part <i>before</i> the `A -> C`) is a sort of "mapping" of the previous solution
    </p>
    <p>
        `A -> B` gets transformed to `A -> C`, `B -> C` gets transformed to `C -> B`, and there's a bunch
        of other rules that i could go over
        <br/>
        similar rules apply for the bottom part, it's just mixed around a bit
    </p>

    <p>
        this basically solves the problem!<br/>
        we just have to recurse all the way to the problem with 1 disk, and then slowly transform our solutions
        and go from there!
    </p>

    <p>
        and without further ado, here's the code
