<h2>sampling methods</h2>

<h3>3 sampling methods liu gave here</h3>
<ul>
  <li>convenience sampling- <b>BIASED</b></li>
  <li>voluntary response sampling- <b>BIASED</b></li>
  <li>simple random sample (SRS)</li>
</ul>

<h3>how to do SRS</h3>
<ol>
  <li>label individuals (assign number or put slips of paper in a hat)</li>
  <li>rng that shit</li>
  <li>select \(x\) of them (\(n\) is the population size)</li>
</ol>

<h2>more random sampling methods (part 1)</h2>

<h2>stratified random sample (also has the SRS acronym, idfk)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>split pop into groups (strata)- <b>preferably groups w/ similar characteristics (homogenous)</b></li>
  <li>choose an SRS from each strata <span class="small">SRS = each member is equally likely to be chosen</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>more sampling methods (part 2)</h2>

<h3>cluster sampling</h3>
<ol>
  <li>split population into groups</li>
  <li>based on location (usually? idk) select random groups and sample everyone there</li>
  <li>heterogeneous (diverse) groups good for representation</li>
</ol>

<h3>overview of all 3 of note</h3>

<h4>stratified sampling</h4>

<img class="half-img" src="img/packet5/stratified.png" alt="stratified shit">

<p>sample some from all groups (homogeneous good)</p>

<h4>cluster sampling</h4>

<img class="half-img" src="img/packet5/cluster.png" alt="cluster shit">

<p>sample all from chosen groups (heterogeneous good)</p>

<h4>systematic sampling</h4>

<p>choose a random start & sample at regular intervals</p>

<h2>problems with sample surveys</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>undercoverage bias:</b> when some population members are less likely to be included</li>
  <li>
    <b>nonresponse bias:</b>
    when an individual is part of a sample but chooses not to respond or can't be reached
  </li>
  <li><b>response bias:</b> pattern of inaccurate results due to some influence (wording, interviewer, lying, etc.)</li>
  <li>voluntary response/self-selected sample, he talked about this previously</li>
  <li>convenience sampling, same as above</li>
</ul>
