        editorial done on request<br/>
        and as usual, the benq editorial was mathy and didn't explain much
    </p>
    <p>
        i can't explain this problem succintly, so it's best if you just go
        read the thing for yourself
    </p>
    <p>
        this is one of those "wth" problems where you have literally no clue
        how to do it except for the brutiest of brute forces
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        but anyways after some malding it's possible for us to figure out that
        each permutation can be decomposed into a series of "cycles"
    </p>

    <p>
        take for example this permutation:
        ```py
        [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
        ```
        then we can take cows 4 & 5, put them in their own group, and
        do the same for cows 1-3
    </p>
    <p>
        each step, the cows in each group rotate, and it takes `the_size_of_their_group` steps
        for the cows to go back to their original position<br/>
        so the amt of time it takes for this permutation to come together is just
        the LCM (least common multiple) of all the group sizes
    </p>

    <p>
        so this problem can be transformed into the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        given a number `n`<br/>
        what's the sum over all distinct values of the LCMs of all
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)">partitions</a> of `n`?
    </blockquote>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        one tiny problem<br/>
        the number of partitions of a `n` increases EXPONENTIALLY as `n` increases
    </p>
    <p>
        good thing we only have to count the # of distinct LCMs<br/>
        because after some more malding, it's possible to notice
        that there's a specific section of all the partitions that
        can represent the entire class of LCMs
    </p>

    <p>
        idk bout you, but when i think of LCMs i think of prime factors<br/>
        so how about we think about (the transformed) problem from the perspective
        of prime numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
        so let's set our `n` to a medium number, say, `50`
        <br/>
        let's also do a random partition, such as
        ```py
        [36, 9, 7, 1]
        ```
        the LCM of this is \( 36 \cdot 7 = 252 \)
    </p>
    <p>
        but here's the thing<br/>
        this partition here, consisting entirely of just prime powers:
        ```py
        [4, 9, 7, 1, 1, (26 more 1's), 1, 1]
        ```
        achieves the same LCM with less space taken up! (the 1's can be considered empty space to a certain degree)
    </p>
    <p>
        so i have a proposal i'd like to make<br/>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        no matter <b>WHAT</b> partition we use, there is always going to be a partition
        consisting <b>only</b> of prime powers and 1's that has the same LCM
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        not really sure how to prove this, it just comes kinda intuitively tbh<br/>
        so just trust me on this<br/>
        i mean you can just transform all partitions into a partition only of prime powers
        with the same LCM by just taking the prime factors and putting them in<br/>
        there's always going to be enough space btw trust me
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        ok so now we know that we only have to check prime powers<br/>
        but here's the kicker<br/>
        that observation was only like 1/3 of the actual problem<br/>
        we now have to actually implement it
    </p>
    <p>
        btw this problem is dp if you didn't know, to get this you have to just
        kinda feel it in your bones or look @ some problem tags
    </p>
    <p>
        so uh let's let
        ```
        dp[i] = sum of all the LCMs of the partitions whose relevant prime powers sum up to i
        ```
        (for example, <code class="language-python">[64, 9, 1, 1, 1]</code> would
        have its LCM accounted for in `dp[73]`)
    </p>
    <p>
        of course, we aren't just going to be only using this array- we're going to
        go through all prime powers and update the array accordingly
    </p>
    <p>
        now comes the part of actually figuring out the relation<br/>
        say we were to add a random prime power \( p^x \) to some partition.
        how would this affect the LCM given that we know the partition knows
        nothing of \( p \) initially?<br/>
        well, it would just multiply the LCM by \( p^x \)!
    </p>
    <p>
        so i guess for each prime power, we just go through all the existing elements
        of `dp`, and then multiply it by said prime power and then go?
    </p>
    <p>
        hm<br/>
        yeah that should work, since we know that none of the partitions we've considered
        have whatever current prime power we're considering
    </p>

<div id="code">
    <p>
        so yeah that's it, the code follows:
    </p>
