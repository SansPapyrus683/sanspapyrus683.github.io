        usaco time
        i've been doing some old problems that i failed at before and found this<br/>
        i thought the solution was hot garbage (no offense benq) so i'm deciding
        to write my own that actually makes sense
    </p>

    <p>
        so<br/>
        we have \(10^5\) line segments, standard stuff<br/>
        and we want the sum of the <i>complexities</i> of each segment, where the complexity is the
        number of connected components in the union of a segment
    </p>

    <p>
        first, because i hate unordered stuff, let's sort the segments by starting point
        and then process them in that order, keeping a <b>running total</b> of the current complexity
    </p>
    <p>
        now, let's see...we have a segment whose starting point is greater than all the others
        along with some previous segments whose endpoints may or may not be less than the current start point 
    </p>
    <p>
        so say we're processing the last segment<br/>
        this results in x2 the # of previous subsets, as for each previous subset
        we can keep it or add the new segment<br/>
        but let's just talk about the part where we add the new segment<br/>
        <b>NOTICE!</b> that this new segment can only either</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            add 1 to the complexity (as it starts a new seg) and this is if the segment occurs strictly after the
            <i>latest endpoint</i> of all the segments in the union
        </li>
        <li>
            have the complexity be the same (i.e. it can't "merge" any previous segments) otherwise
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>(idk how to 100% prove this, just trust me that it works bro i swear it does)</p>

    <p>
        so when we process a new segment, we first double the current total then add<br/>
        2^(number of segments that occur strictly before the current one)<br/>
        why? uuuuhh
    </p>

    <p>
        look given that case 1 happens only when the segment occurs after the latest endpoint, it also
        means that it only happens if all of the previous subset was before the current start,
        so we need to add (again) the # of previous subsets, which is that 2^ thing
    </p>

    <p>
        actually lemme just given an example here:
    </p>
    ```
    [[[--]][--[----]]---]
    segments: [[0, 20], [1, 6], [2, 5], [7, 16], [10, 15]]
    ```
    <p>
        closing brackets represent the start of a segment & ending brackets represent the end<br/>
        now say we're processing the last segment in that list<br/>
        the previous complexity is- actually that doesn't matter, let's just call it `total`<br/>
        so first we double `total`, and then we count the # of case 1's<br/>
        `[10, 15]` is completely ahead of 2 segments, so we add 2^2 = 4 to the already doubled total
    </p>

    <p>
        phew!<br/>
        now it remains to find the # of segments that occur strictly before the current one<br/>
        you can do this w/ prefix sums, but my dumb self thought that i had to do this w/ a
        goddamn <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/fenwick.html">BIT</a>
    </p>
</div>

<div id="code">
    <p>
        but anyways, if you want the solution, here it is
    </p>

    ```cpp
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;fstream&gt;
    #include &lt;vector&gt;
    #include &lt;algorithm&gt;

    using std::cout;
    using std::endl;
    using std::vector;

    constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

    // i mean a prefix sum would also work but i'm too lazy
    class BITree {
        private:
            vector&lt;int&gt; bit;
            int size;
        public:
            BITree(int size) : bit(size + 1), size(size) { }

            void increment(int updateAt, int val) {
                updateAt++;  // have the driver code not worry about 1-indexing
                for (; updateAt &lt;= size; updateAt += updateAt &amp; -updateAt) {
                    bit[updateAt] += val;
                }
            }

            int query(int ind) {  // sum of elements in [0, ind]
                ind++;
                int sum = 0;
                for (; ind &gt; 0; ind -= ind &amp; -ind) {
                    sum += bit[ind];
                }
                return sum;
            }
    };

    // 2020 feb gold
    int main() {
        std::ifstream read(&quot;help.in&quot;);
        int range_num;
        read &gt;&gt; range_num;

        vector&lt;int&gt; two_pows(range_num + 1);
        two_pows[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; two_pows.size(); i++) {
            two_pows[i] = (two_pows[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
        }

        vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; ranges(range_num);
        // going to assume valid input, screw you validate your own input
        BITree prev_ranges(2 * range_num);
        for (std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;&amp; r : ranges) {
            read &gt;&gt; r.first &gt;&gt; r.second;
            r.first--;
            r.second--;
            prev_ranges.increment(r.second, 1);
        }
        std::sort(ranges.begin(), ranges.end());

        long long total = 0;
        for (int r = 0; r &lt; range_num; r++) {
            int start = ranges[r].first;
            int prev = start != 0 ? prev_ranges.query(start - 1) : 0;
            total = (total * 2 + two_pows[prev]) % MOD;
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; total &lt;&lt; endl;
        std::ofstream(&quot;help.out&quot;) &lt;&lt; total &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    ```
