<h1>assign 4</h1>

<p>
    man this assignment is all over the place, i'm like 90% sure eggert wrote this on acid<br/>
    i'll try to include SO links that might be helpful wherever i can
</p>

<p>
    this one also has a lot of things that could be dependent on the quarter you take him,
    so i'll suffix all of those with a <b>(QD)</b> for "quarter-dependent"
</p>

<p>
    alot of questions also want you to explain what you did to get the answer in `notes.txt`, so i'll
    suffix those with <b>(N)</b>
</p>

<h2>basic diffing</h2>

<p>
    that narcissist eggert wants us to work on his lil <a href="https://github.com/eggert/tz">tzdb repo</a>...<br/>
    so clone that baby with this:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eggert/tz
    ```
    and let's get to work!
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        oops i lied about using git, first he wants you to do some stuff on github<br/>
        go to the tzdb url and
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49838096/12128483">
            diff the current commit with the second most recent commit</a>
        once you're at the diff page, just ctrl+s that baby and save it as `prevcur.html`<br/>
        you might notice that when you view the html file you saved it looks awful, but that's to be expected!<br/>
        also, don't worry if eggert commits some stuff during the assignment, thus changing the definition of
        "most recent commit", as idt the TAs care too much anyways <b>(N)</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        now use github to
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/comparing-releases">
            compare the releases</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/eggert/tz/releases/tag/2023d">2023d</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/eggert/tz/releases/tag/2024a">2024a</a> <b>(QD)</b>
        and save that baby in a file named `2023d-2024a.html` <b>(QD, N)</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        ok now we actually get to work on that local copy of the repo<br/>
        make a bash/python script named `justone` that
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3368758/12128483">outputs the difference</a>
        between the previous and current commit when run in a git repo <b>(N)</b><br/>
        if written in bash, this script should be really straightforward with just one line of code
    </li>
    <li>
        once you have that script, run `justone` in that tz repo and put the output in a file
        named `justone.out` like so:
        ```bash
        ./justone >justone.out
        ```
    </li>
    <li>
        ok now write a script `compare-releases` that
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3211829/12128483">compares two releases</a>
        given as arguments to the bash script <b>(N)</b><br/>
        like `justone`, this should be really simply, one line of bash
    </li>
    <li>
        yeah basically do the same thing you did w/ `justone`: run it in the tz repo and put the output in a file
        ```bash
        ./compare-releases 2023d 2024a >2023d-2024a.diff  # QD
        ```
        why `.diff` for this and `.out` for the other? hell if i know.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>general crap</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        alright so this next script, `tzcount` needs a bit more effort<br/>
        it should take any commit range <a href='https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log'>`git log`</a> takes and calculate
        the number of commits from each time zone in that range <b>(N)</b><br/>
        the output might look something like this:
        ```
        -0800 12
        -0400 1
        -0300 3
        +0200 10
        ```
        notice how the time zones are sorted in <i>numerical order</i><br/>
        you can get an idea of how to get the time zone by checking out
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats">this part</a> of the `git log` docs<br/>
        i also found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49964914/12128483">this informative link</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        why the hell do the TAs need your cmd output why can't they just run it themselves:
        ```bash
        ./tzcount 2012j..2024a >tzdb-2012j-2024a.tzcount  # QD
        ```
    </li>
    <li>
        find the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5816177/12128483">commit with this substring</a>:
        <blockquote>
            Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.
        </blockquote>
        in a text file `who-contributed.txt`, put the commands you used and the following to be safe:
        <ul>
            <li>commit hash</li>
            <li>date of the commit</li>
            <li>author of the commit</li>
            <li>anything other you think is notable about the commit (perhaps regarding the author?)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    alright quick thing- after all these exercises he wants us to change to
    <a href="https://github.com/git/git">git's own source code</a>
</p>

<ol start="4">
    <li>
        ok have this commit hash
        ```
        c03bee6e9f5c05259f5f501e1f47cd8adb63af38  (QD)
        ```
        now draw the directed graph of all paths towards this commit from the earlier commit in `git-graph.pdf`
        ```
        2a7d63a2453e2c30353342a2c9385fa22a846987 (QD)
        ```
        each node in the graph should have the commit hash, author, and committer<br/>
        they say only include committer if different but i got docked for not including that ðŸ’€<br/>
        oh yeah, the arrows should point from the child to the parent
        (usually the earlier and later commit respectively)<br/>
        <span class="small">
            hey, did you know that `git log` has a
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---graph">`--graph`</a> option?
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        ok so in the git git repo, run <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch">`git branch`</a> rq<br/>
        ok now do the same for the git repo located on the seasnet server at `~eggert/src/github/git`<br/>
        any differences? log them in `git.txt`
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>who the hell fixed this?</h2>

<p>
    ok so the
    <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.39.0.txt#L190">git 2.39 release notes</a>
    say that an issue that could cause segfaults was fixed, which is pretty cool
</p>

<p>
    now, eggert wants you to find the commit that actually fixed this<br/>
    in a file named `git-detective.txt`, put the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>how you got the answer</li>
    <li>the title, author, and hash of the commit</li>
    <li>the file the commit touched that fixed the issue</li>
    <li>how did this commit fix the issue?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    also, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6658352/12128483">gen the patch file</a> for the commit, and
    document how you did so in `git-detective.txt` too<br/>
    oh yeah submit the patch file too
</p>

<h3>hopefully helpful hints</h3>

<ul>
    <li>ok so this bug got fixed in 2.39, which means it was probably present in some other version...</li>
    <li>
        try looking for keywords like "segfault" or "merge"<br/>
        the cool thing about this repo is that the commit messages are actually descriptive and talk about
        what their respective commits actually do/fix
    </li>
</ul>
