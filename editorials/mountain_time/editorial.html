        first editorial that i can be informal in hooray
    </p>

    <p>
        anyway the editorial is for this problem it's kinda misleading- they say that the prominence is
        `h_min`, when it's really the `elevation - h_min`
    </p>

    <p>
        but anyways, this is a dsu problem, if dsu was awful and something you wanted
        to rage at every night (the 2d aspect doesn't make it any better)
        <br>
        i'll assume you know enough about dsu to not die on a simple problem about it
    </p>

    <p>
        so you add the squares in one at a time from highest to lowest and link them to any
        previously added squares with some standard dsu stuff
        <br>
        but because the writers were sadistic you need to keep the tallest mountain in each dsu component
        (if there's multiple you need to keep all of them)
    </p>

    <p>
        then when you link two components (i'll call them A and B for simplicity)
        with some square of elevation e, you compare the highest mountains in each component
        <br>
        there's 3 cases for this comparison:
    </p>

    <ol>
    <li>
        they're equal, in which case you just merge the mountains, standard carp
    </li>
    <li>
        the tallest mountains in A are taller than the ones in B, in which case the h_min of the mountains in B are e
        <br>
        this is because the current square is the tallest square that can link the squares from B to A
        (the ones with the strictly higher mountains)-
        note that we can say this only because we add the squares from the highest to lowest
    </li>
    <li>
        just reverse case of 2, where the ones in B are taller than the ones in A if you
        can't figure out this by your own you're high
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        of course you need to still do the standard dsu stuff as mentioned above or else this thing'll be slow as heck
    </p>
    <p>
        there's a separate case for the highest mountains because they'll never hit case 2 or 3,
        so we just manually set the prominence of them to their current elevation
    </p>
