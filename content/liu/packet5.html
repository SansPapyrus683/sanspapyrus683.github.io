<h1>hw packet 5</h1>

<h2>sampling methods</h2>

<h3>3 sampling methods liu gave here</h3>
<ul>
    <li>convenience sampling- <b>BIASED</b></li>
    <li>voluntary response sampling- <b>BIASED</b></li>
    <li>simple random sample (SRS)</li>
</ul>

<h3>how to do SRS</h3>
<ol>
    <li>label individuals (assign number or put slips of paper in a hat)</li>
    <li>rng that shit</li>
    <li>select \(x\) of them (\(n\) is the population size)</li>
</ol>

<h2>more random sampling methods (part 1)</h2>

<h2>stratified random sample (also has the SRS acronym, idfk)</h2>

<ol>
    <li>split pop into groups (strata)- <b>preferably groups w/ similar characteristics (homogenous)</b></li>
    <li>choose an SRS from each strata <span class="small">SRS = each member is equally likely to be chosen</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>more sampling methods (part 2)</h2>

<h3>cluster sampling</h3>
<ol>
    <li>split population into groups</li>
    <li>based on location (usually? idk) select random groups and sample everyone there</li>
    <li>heterogeneous (diverse) groups good for representation</li>
</ol>

<h3>overview of all 3 of note</h3>

<h4>stratified sampling</h4>

<img class="half-img center" src="img/packet5/stratified.png" alt="stratified shit"/>

<p>sample some from all groups (homogeneous good)</p>

<h4>cluster sampling</h4>

<img class="half-img center" src="img/packet5/cluster.png" alt="cluster shit"/>

<p>sample all from chosen groups (heterogeneous good)</p>

<h4>systematic sampling</h4>

<p>choose a random start & sample at regular intervals</p>

<h2>problems with sample surveys</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>undercoverage bias:</b> when some population members are less likely to be included</li>
    <li>
        <b>nonresponse bias:</b>
        when an individual is part of a sample but chooses not to respond or can't be reached
    </li>
    <li><b>response bias:</b> pattern of inaccurate results due to some influence (wording, interviewer, lying, etc.)</li>
    <li>voluntary response/self-selected sample, he talked about this previously</li>
    <li>convenience sampling, same as above</li>
</ul>

<h2>observational studies & experiments</h2>

<img class="half-img center" src="img/packet5/causation.png" alt="causation diagram"/>

<ul>
    <li><b>A:</b> explanatory variable- helps explain/predict B</li>
    <li><b>B:</b> response variable- outcome being measured</li>
    <li><b>C:</b> confounding variable- influences A & B</li>
</ul>

<h3>random fuckass definitions about experiments and stuff</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>observational study:</b> no <u>imposed</u> treatment</li>
    <li><b>experiment:</b> treatments imposed, allows us to show causation</li>
    <li><b>experimental units:</b> what/who the treatment's imposed on</li>
    <li><b>treatment:</b> what's done (OR NOT DONE) to the experimental units</li>
</ul>

<h2>randomized block designs</h2>

<p>
    <b>block:</b> group of experimental units that are similar-
    different from stratify in that it's used to assign treatments, not to select units<br/>
    so essentially you stratify, <i>then</i> block
</p>
<p><b>randomized block design:</b> separate subjects and then RNG assign within each block<br/></p>

<b>matched pairs design:</b>
<ul>
    <li>subjects are paired (blocks of size 2) and then randomly assigned to a treatment</li>
    <li><b>OR:</b> each subject receives 2 treatments (ORDER MUST BE RANDOMIZED)</li>
</ul>

<h3>the hw diagram for problem 2 on the front of the packet</h3>

<img class="half-img center" src="img/packet5/sat_exp.png" alt="diagram for the front of the hw packet"/>

couple things:
<ul>
    <li>be sure to include the RNG assignment block!</li>
    <li>you have to compare among each block first</li>
</ul>

    be sure to state context for whatever claim you're making,
    not sure if you bombed the quiz like i did bc of that but still
