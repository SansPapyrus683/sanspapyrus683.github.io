<h2>chi-square test for goodness of fit</h2>

<p>
    this test is used to compare categorical distributions and see how
    likely it is you got one by sampling from the other
</p>

<h3>hypotheses</h3>

<p>
    \(H_0\): the claimed distr [ctx] is true<br/>
    \(H_a\): the claimed distr [ctx] <i>isn't</i> true
</p>

<h3>conditions</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>rng</b></li>
    <li><b>10%:</b> sum of all instances (in the harvard wksht it was 2023 total admits)</li>
    <li><b>large counts:</b> expected counts of all categories is at least 5!! not 10, 5!!!</li>
</ul>

<h3>formula</h3>

\[\chi^2=\sum \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}\]

<p>
    here, O is the observed value & E is the expected value for each category<br/>
    then use chi squared cdf on your calculator w/ df = (# of categories) - 1
    to get the final p-value
</p>

<h3>pic</h3>

<p>
    here's what shit looks like
</p>

<img class="center half-img" src="img/packet14/chi_squared.png" alt="pic of the chi squared distr"/>

<p>
    lime green area is what you shade & calculate the area of to get the p-value
</p>

<p>
    be sure to indicate the df<br/>
    personally i also like to indicate where 0 is, but who knows
</p>

<h2>chi-square test for homo</h2>

<h3>hypotheses</h3>

<p>
    \(H_0\): there's no diff in the [categorical var] distr between [pop 1] & [pop 2]<br/>
    \(H_a\): there <i>is</i> a diff in yeah yeah we fucking get it
</p>

<p>
    conditions are basically the same,
    just a couple of things that make this different from the last one
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        expected counts for each cell =
        \(\text{sample total} \cdot \frac{\text{category total}}{\text{total total}}\)
    </li>
    <li>\(\text{df}=(\text{# of cat vars} - 1)(\text{# of samples} - 1)\)</li>
    <li>this one is 2 samples 1 var, the last one was 1 sample 1 var</li>
</ul>

<h2>chi-square test for independence</h2>

<h3>hypotheses</h3>

<p>
    \(H_0\): there <i>isn't</i> an assoc. between var 1 & var 2
    \(H_a\): there is one
</p>

<h3>what the fuck is the difference between all these tests</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>gof:</b> 1 sample, 1 var, testing if a claimed distribution actually works</li>
    <li><b>homo:</b> 2+ samples, 1 var, testing if being in a diff sample makes any diff</li>
    <li><b>indep:</b> 1 sample, 2 vars, testing if across the same sample shit's related</li>
</ul>

<h2>sampling distribution of b</h2>

<p>
    so if we want to predict a correlation between two variables,
    this is the true equation- "god's equation", if you will:
    \[\mu_y=\alpha+\beta x\]
</p>

<p>
    but of course, we are pathetically limited in our ability to predict it- the best we can do is a:
    \[\hat{y}=a+bx\]
</p>

<p>
    here's a table comparing the stat (what we predict)
    vs the parameter (the actual parameter irl set by god)
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>stat</td>
        <td>parameter</td>
    </tr>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>y-intercept</td>
        <td class="border">a</td>
        <td class="border">\(\alpha\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>slope</td>
        <td class="border">b</td>
        <td class="border">\(\beta\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>residual SD</td>
        <td class="border">s</td>
        <td class="border">\(\sigma\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>slope SD</td>
        <td class="border">\(\text{SE}_b\)</td>
        <td class="border">\(\sigma_b\)</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    due to some stat fuckery, the distribution of all possible slopes
    takes on a normal distribution with mean \(\beta\) and stdev \(\sigma_b\)
    (which we use \(\text{SE}_b\) to approximate)
</p>

<p>
    if you wanna do a hypo test, set the mean to be 0 & go from there
</p>

<h2>CIs for slope</h2>

<p>
    <b>OH MY FUCKING GOD HOW MANY 4-STEP PROCESSES ARE THERE 老子他妈要吐了</b>
</p>

<h3>state</h3>

<p>
    <b>param:</b> \(\beta\) is the true slope of the population lsrl for [x-ctx] and [y-ctx]<br/>
    also confidence level
</p>

<h3>plan</h3>

<p>
    <b>name:</b> 1-sample t-interval for slope
</p>

<h4>conditions</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b><span class="big">L</span></b>inear:
        i mean the scatterplot has to look promising;
        for this you plot the data (lsrl too? maybe just to be safe) & do a residual graph too because fuck you
    </li>
    <li><b><span class="big">I</span></b>ndependent: 10% or random ass, whichever applies</li>
    <li>
        <b><span class="big">N</span></b>ormal:
        make a histogram/dotplot of the residuals-
        it better look normal or else you're getting sent to the stats gulag by andrew
    </li>
    <li><b><span class="big">E</span></b>qual stdev: no christmas tree pattern (homoscedasticity i think?)</li>
    <li><b><span class="big">R</span></b>andom: duh</li>
</ul>

<h3>do</h3>

<p>
    formula is p simple: \(b \pm t^* \cdot \text{SE}_b\)
</p>

<p>
    in this case, df = n - 2 bc there's 2 unknown variables? bro idfk<br/>
    for \(\text{SE}_b\) they usually give you it but just in case liu feels especially sadistic on test day:
</p>

\[s=\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma (y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2}{n-2}}\]
\[\sigma_b=\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_x \sqrt{n}}\]
\[\text{SE}_b=\frac{s}{s_x \sqrt{n-1}}\]

<h3>conclude</h3>

<p>
    fuck you
</p>

<h2>significance test for slope</h2>

<p>
    ok the test is basically the same, just remember to use the t-distr bc we don't know true \(\sigma\)
</p>

<h3>state</h3>

<p>
    \(\beta\)= true slope of population lsrl for x = [x ctx] and y = [y ctx]
</p>

<h4>hypotheses</h4>

<p>
    null hypothesis is \(\beta=0\)<br/>
    alt is less than, greater than, or not equal to 0, pretty standard shit
</p>

<h3>do (conditions are same so skipped plan)</h3>

<p>
    formula is shockingly simple, it's just \(\frac{b-\beta}{\text{SE}_b}\)<br/>
    then you use \(\text{tcdf}\) (remember to draw the picture!!) and you have the p-value
</p>

<h3>conclude</h3>

<p>
    lmao
