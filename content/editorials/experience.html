        hi i'm back with another solution thing<br/>
        whatever you like to call it
    </p>
    <p>
        this time it's this problem from the codeforces educational portal or whatever
    </p>
    <p>pretty standard dsu problem, except this time you need to</p>
    <ol>
        <li>get the value of a certain node</li>
        <li>increment all the values of a set (given by a certain node) by some value</li>
    </ol>

    <p>and there's the standard linking operation but that's obvious lmao</p>
    <p>
        so at first i thought about storing points in a `points` array and then just
        incrementing the root of each set when the input asked me to increment a set<br/>
        then when they queried for the amt of points
        i could just sum up the `points` array for each node that was on the path
        from the current node to the root and win basically</p>

    <p>
        but then i realized if the root already had some previous value when
        it was declared as the parent of another set, this would also cause the set that was
        merged into the parent to be incremented by what was already in the root
    </p>
    <p>
        take the sample input for example- we have `points[1]` to be `100`,
        but then when we merge node `3` into node `1`, now the algorithm thinks that node `3` also has `100` points,
        even though it was just node `1`
    </p>
    <p>
        so we fix this by keeping an array `extra_points` that stores the initial value
        in the root and then subtract the values in the array when querying to tell all the points
        that were previously there when merged to screw off
    </p>
    <p>
        also disclaimer path compression isn't used because it would mess up the algorithm<br/>
        think it's still possible tho
    </p>
