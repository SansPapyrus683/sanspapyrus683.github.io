<h1>assign 3</h1>

<p>
    honestly this is one of the better written specs, but you may beg to differ
</p>

<h2>ok how do i install node?</h2>

<p>
    oh yeah, you may not even have node js installed, so lemme give you some instructions
</p>

<h3>linux/macos</h3>

<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">nvm</a> is a pretty darn tool thing that allows
    you to install node without any fuss
    <br/>
    just follow the <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">instructions here</a> and you should have it installed
</p>

<p>
    after that, run this command here:
    ```bash
    nvm install node
    ```
    and you should have a cool fresh version of node on your computer!
</p>

<h3>windows</h3>

<p>
    god windows sucks for development<br/>
    but regardless, you can just download it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">here</a> and then
    run it like any other windows installer
</p>

<h2>literally just follow a tutorial</h2>

<p>
    what the title said.<br/>
    build the tic tac toe app as described in <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe">this link</a>
</p>

<p>
    the awful thing about this assignment is that you have to keep a log of everything you do in a file
    named `tic-tac-toe.txt`, like what you wrote, what happened, etc.
</p>

<p>
    to give you an idea of what this file might look like, here's the start of mine that got full credit:
</p>
<details>
    <summary>ks notes</summary>
    <p>
        INITIAL SETUP
    </p>
    <p>
        used <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>
        to initialize the directory and install react
    </p>
    <p>
        following the directions, created `index.js`, `App.js`, and `styles.css` with
        the template source code initially given
    </p>
    <P>
        the initial code just rendered a single X, so i duplicated it a lot of times
        to render an actual tic-tac-toe board
    </P>
    <p>
        i then did some refactoring by renaming the current component to `Board`
        and moving the `button`s back to their own component with a prop for their value
        ```js
        function Square({ value }) {
            return &lt;button className=&quot;square&quot;&gt;{value}&lt;/button&gt;;
        }
        ```
    </p>
</details>
<p>
    you don't have to write it exactly as i did, or even do what i did in those notes!<br/>
    the excerpt is just to give you a bit of an idea for what it <i>might</i> look like
</p>

<h2>ok this one actually takes work</h2>

<p>
    now eggert asks you to make some stupid alternate version of tic tac toe called "chorus lapilli"<br/>
    it's like that game, except for these two things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        after your first 3 moves, instead of adding further pieces you have to instead move one of your existing pieces
        to an adjacent empty square<br/>
        the move can be up, down, left, right, or diagonal
    </li>
    <li>
        if it's your turn <b>AND</b> you have three pieces on the board <b>AND</b> one of your pieces is in
        the center square, your move must either win or vacate the center square
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    if you want an example of an app that got full credit, i actually managed to deploy
    my work for this assignment to <a href="https://cs35l.vercel.app/">this silly little url</a>
</p>

<p>
    the time travel feature is optional, but i found implementing it to be a pretty fun exercise
</p>

<p>
    unfortunately, you do have to do that stupid lab notebook thing in `chorus-lapilli.txt`<br/>
    but you don't have to restart from scratch!
    i believe you can just say something like "starting off from that tic tac toe project i built..." and that'll work
</p>

<p>
    another thing is, at least for my quarter the notes were worth like 10% of this assignment's grade<br/>
    so don't stress if you can't write them in time haha
</p>

<h3>some guidelines the TAs gave</h3>

<ol>
    <li>`npm start` should start your app (yeah obviously)</li>
    <li>the game should prevent invalid moves</li>
    <li>some text should be shown on the screen when a winning move is made</li>
    <li>
        no popups, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert">`alert`</a>, new tabs, etc.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>unit tests which they retconned for winter i'm still mad</h2>

<p>
    take a gander at
    <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter24/cs35L/assign/test_chorus_lapilli.py">this testing script</a><br/>
    it does need <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/">selenium</a>,
    which you can install with this command here:
    ```bash
    pip install selenium  # wow, that was easy
    ```
</p>

<p>
    but uh yeah, add 3 new tests to the section labelled "ADD YOUR TESTS HERE"
</p>

<p>
    be sure to prefix all your tests with `test_`!
    for example, one of my testing functions goes something like this
    ```py
    def test_redundant_click(self):
        """Check that clicking a tile twice doesn't change its value."""
        pass  # testing code goes down here
    ```
</p>

<p>
    since the seasnet servers don't have browsers, this is one of those rare things that you can't do on seasnet
</p>
<p>
    instead, put the file they gave in the root of your `chorus_lapilli` project or whatever you called it
    and execute it (`python3` or `./`, either is fine) to test your project!
</p>

<h2>what to turn in</h2>

<p>
    alright so first you have to make sure all the files in the project are present<br/>
    i did a `tree` command at the root of my project and got this stuff (excluding `.node_modules`):
    ```
    .
    ├── chorus-lapilli.txt
    ├── package.json
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── public
    │   ├── favicon.ico
    │   ├── index.html
    │   ├── logo192.png
    │   ├── logo512.png
    │   ├── manifest.json
    │   └── robots.txt
    ├── src
    │   ├── App.js
    │   ├── index.js
    │   └── styles.css
    ├── test_chorus_lapilli.py
    └── tic-tac-toe.txt
    ```
</p>
<p>
    please don't worry if your file structure doesn't match this exactly!
    just make sure of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>that `npm start` can start your project successfully (check on the seasnet servers!)</li>
    <li>
        you have these files named exactly at the root of the project:
        <ul>
            <li>`tic-tac-toe.txt`</li>
            <li>`chorus-lapilli.txt`</li>
            <li>`test_chorus_lapilli.py`- why this one uses underscores, i have no idea</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    then, run this command in the project directory
    ```bash
    npm pack
    ```
    it should generate a neatly packaged `.tgz` file- just rename that lil thing `chorus-lapilli.tgz` and you're gtg!
