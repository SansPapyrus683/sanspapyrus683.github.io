<h2>estimating a population mean - intro</h2>

<p>
    so recall that the std dev of a sampling distr of a population for the mean was \(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)<br/>
    yeah to get the CI of a mean we do this:
    \[\bar{x} \pm t^* \cdot \frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}}\]
</p>

<p>
    to find \(t^*\) we do \(\text{invT}(area=\text{left tail area}, df=n-1)\)<br/>
    liu also says use table b but what sane person would actually do that wtf
</p>

<h3>conditions for this CI</h3>

<ul>
    <li>rng (remember to specify if sample or assignment!)</li>
    <li>10% (doesn't apply for assignment)</li>
    <li>
        normal/large sample-
        if <b>ANY</b> of these conditions are satisfied you're golden
        <ul>
            <li>population distr is ~normal</li>
            <li>\(n \geq 30\)</li>
            <li>sample data doesn't have skews/outliers to infer the first condition</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>tHE fOUr sTEP pROCEss</h2>

<p>
    alr i think we all know how shit works at this point
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>state:</b> parameter & confidence level</li>
    <li><b>plan:</b> one sample t-interval for \(\mu\), conditions are above</li>
    <li><b>do:</b> formula, work, & answer (formula is above)</li>
    <li><b>conclude:</b> same as how we did the conclusion for \(p\)'s CI</li>
</ol>

<h2>confidence intervals for a difference in means</h2>

<p>
    uh same shit as always, just now \(\text{df}\) is calculated a bit weird<br/>
    you can either use the lower of the two sample sizes or use the one your calc gives you
</p>

<p>
    shit also forgot that now uh
    \(\text{SE}=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\)
</p>

<h2>confidence interval for paired data</h2>

<p>
    it's now called a "1-sample t-interval for \(\mu_\text{diff}\)"<br/>
    and we subscript \(\mu\), \(\bar{x}\), and s with \(\text{diff}\)<br/>
    stupid shit, really, but hey, what u gon' do bout it
