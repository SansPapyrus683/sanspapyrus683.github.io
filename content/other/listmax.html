    <p>
    so i was watching this video
    </p>

    <p>
        <iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0MhVkKHYUAY" title="New Python Coders Be Like..." frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>

    <p>
        i was like "no way a for loop can be that much slower than `max()`"<br/>
        so i decided to do some simple performance testing based on the file in the vid<br/>
        <b>YES, I KNOW THIS VIDEO IS A JOKE, I'M JUST HYPERFIXATING ON IT FOR SOME TIME</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        so the video gives a 5 kb file which magically turns into a 12.7 kb file, so i'm using 12.7 kb as the size<br/>
        each number is about 22, 25 characters long, but i'll just use 20 chars to be generous
    </p>

    <p>
        now a character is a single byte, so there's \(\frac{12.7 \cdot 10^3}{20 \cdot 1}=635\) numbers
    </p>

    <p>
        and i'm already like "no goddamn way his code is this slow"<br/>
        but i decided to test it anyway with ipython and see for myself
    </p>

    ```py
    In [1]: import random

    In [2]: SIZE = 635

    In [3]: %%timeit
    ...: arr = [random.uniform(0, 200) for _ in range(SIZE)]
    ...: max_value = arr[0]
    ...: for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    ...:     if arr[i] > max_value:
    ...:         max_value = arr[i]
    ...:
    138 µs ± 2.59 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)
    ```

    <p>
        yeah, that's way faster than what's shown in the video<br/>
        but the discord user "P Solver" advocates for using `max()`, so i wanted to see how much faster that actually
        was just for the sake of it
    </p>

    ```py
    In [4]: %%timeit
    ...: arr = [random.uniform(0, 200) for _ in range(SIZE)]
    ...: max_value = max(arr)
    119 µs ± 536 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)
    ```

    <p>
        hm, only faster by a couple of microseconds <br/>
        but that's including the array generation (to simulate parsing the array, probably bad but) <br/>
        ok let's just try raw maximum calculation
    </p>

    ```py
    In [5]: %%timeit
    ...: max_value = arr[0]
    ...: for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    ...:     if arr[i] > max_value:
    ...:         max_value = arr[i]
    ...:
    25.5 µs ± 477 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

    In [6]: %timeit max_value = max(arr)
    5.12 µs ± 11.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
    ```

    <p>
        ok yeah lmao i stand corrected <br/>
        `max()` is goddamn <i><b>five times faster</b></i> than the pitiful loop
    </p>

    <p>
        hate to admit it, but p solver was right <br/>
        oh well, life isn't always fair
    </p>

    <p>
        and yeah that's the whole post, nothing else lmfao
