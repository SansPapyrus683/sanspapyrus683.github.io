<h2>interesting takes</h2>

<p>
    although there are some funny takes i found, a lot of these quotes are just INSANELY raw
</p>

<p>
    however, there are some quotes that i think are bad takes
</p>

<h2>actual commentary</h2>

<p>
    <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i> by Neil Postman initially comes off as an
    "old man yells at cloud" kind of situation, but upon reading it, the author builds
    a fairly strong argument on the negative effects he believes TV has had on society.
    At the start of the book, he takes care to make his thesis, that TV has done irreparable damage
    to the specific area of public political discourse, very clear, and I respect him for that.
    Although occasionally the logical links fall short, I found myself agreeing with him for the most part.
    It's interesting how this book still managed to have the general point "technology bad" while still
    bringing a different POV than the previous book on tech I read, <i>Alone Together</i> by Sherry Turkle.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="small">yeah i'm writing these commentaries out of order lol what u gon do bout it</span>
</p>

<p>
    Before I start though, I'd just like to mention that I found it amusing how Postman
    <i>never</i> uses the abbreviation "TV" in place of television.
    Given how often he uses the word, you'd think he'd take the opportunity to save
    a bit of typing time (or perhaps he wrote drafts by hand, in which case my point is only stronger) and ink,
    but maybe using the abbreviation makes you come off as uncultured in the world of grad students and PhDs.
    Who knows?
    I'm not even into my second year of college yet as I'm writing this.
</p>

<p>
    Postman starts off reminiscing about the good old days back when print used to reign supreme.
    As stupid as this may sound, he makes a good case for the benefits of a print-only society.
    If I got his point correctly, back then people communicated solely through print,
    which allowed for more time to reflect on the content presented.
    He uses advertisements back then as an strong example.
    Apparently they used to only consist of text, and as I read them I felt like the
    advertiser was just trying to make a logical argument as to why I should buy their services.
    Even though it was short, I found that it needed more of my brainpower than a
    15-second YouTube ad could ever require.
</p>

<p>
    He then links the thinking and attention spans people developed while reading pure print
    to the speeches politicians gave at the time too.
    He brings up Lincoln-Douglas debates, demonstrating how back then people could listen
    to logical explanations of political issues for hours on end.
    According to him, these speeches could last for 2, maybe 3 hours, which is quite amazing.
    My sorry self can't even pay attention to a 50-minute math lecture without picking up my phone!
    But in the end I think Postman tries to make the point that back then people had a higher capacity
    to think, which is a futile point to argue simply due to the state of the world at the time.
    The 18th and 19th centuries were very xenophobic, racist, imperialistic,
    and a bunch of other bad things, so did the people back then really have good thinking skills?
    Even though it wasn't those adjectives as much as previous centuries,
    I still don't think you can say that people had better critical thinking skills at the time.
</p>

<p>
    An interesting comparison I think that's worth making comes from one of Postman's subpoints that
    men were judged primarily by the quality of their writing, aka how good their takes were.
    He says that most people engaged with famous people primarily through works of writing, so
    even presidents could probably walk along a street in New York without getting noticed.
    Now, I feel with the rise of social media platforms like Twitter (I will NEVER call it X) and Reddit,
    we've looped back to judging people by their takes.
    You don't see the face on the other side of the screen; it's just a profile picture
    with some text underneath it.
    TODO
</p>

<p>
    The next parts of the book talk about how we got from spending meaningful time with books to getting
    our attention spans absolutely demolished by TV.
    Postman starts with the telegraph, believing that it was when newspapers started to fill
    their pages with yapping instead of actual content.
    This is one of the weakest logical links in this book (though I still personally agree with the results),
    is that somehow newspapers managed to turn from well thought-out political analysis and opinions
    to just constant yapping about random stuff and brainrot throughout the nation as soon as
    the telegraph was invented.
    It's probably just me, but I fail to understand if there really are any differences in newspapers
    (besides the ads) before and after the telegraph.
    These papers probably always had sensational stories, <span class="small">right</span>?
</p>

<p>
    I also wanted to bring up a particularly raw quote about world news that Postman brought up:
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>
    Near the end of the book, I think in one of the final chapters, Postman laments the damage
    that TV has done to the education system as well.

    kang 12, birbeck quad formula, but that might just be hindsight or confirmation bias or whatever<br/>
    106- american knowledge of the iran hostage crisis, 108- reagan lies<br/>
    novels vs tv for entertainment?
</p>

<p>
    While he does present a weird solution that involves having school teach kids on how to
    somehow consume TV better or whatever, I think there's a much simpler solution
    that is also easier to implement: just ban tech in schools!
    I think we can all agree that childhood consists of some of the most formative years of a person's life,
    so as long as we can develop those logical reading skills and attention span Postman thinks were
    so critical to his vision of the healthy political discourse back then, then we should be well
    on our way to a healthier public discourse.
</p>

<p>
    <b>final rating: 8.5/10</b>
    great takes intermixed with some questionable ones and decent humor throughout,
    so i'll place it slightly above the bobos book by brooks
