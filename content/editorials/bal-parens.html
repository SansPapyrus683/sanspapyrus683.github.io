    <p>
        i'm back!!!11!!
    </p>

    <p>
        and this time i'm not gonna do some cf problem, it's actually going to one from codewars
    </p>

    <p>
        the problem itself is actually kinda simple
        <br/>
        it gives you n, and asks you to find the element at the ith index in a sorted list of all balanced parenthesis
        <br/>
        so like if n was 3, the list would be this:
    </p>
    ```py
    ["((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"]
    ```

    <p>
        and you have to find whatever element at whatever position it asks you to find
    </p>

    <p>
        i was stuck on this problem for like 2 whole days then i realized it was way simpler than i thought
    </p>

    <p>
        so let's build the parenthesis one by one, using
        <code class="language-py">bal_parens(3, 2)</code> as an example
        <br/>
        we start with an empty string with an opening parenthesis (since it has to start w/ one):
    </p>

    ```py
    '('
    ```

    <p>
        now, how do we know whether we should add a `)` or another `(`?
    </p>
    <p>
        well, notice that if we add a `)`, we've limited ourselves to only being able to
        make the last 2 elements of the list
        <br/>
        (remember that the list is sorted in alphabetical order, so we can make this assumption)
        <br/>
        we want the 3rd element, so it's obvious why we can't add a `)`- we have to add a `(`
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>NOTE!</b> that if we had wanted the second half of the list, we'd have to subtract
        3 (the size of the first half) from our target index to maintain the accuracy of the value
    </p>

    <p>
        now onto the next choice- another `(` or a `)`?
        <br/>
        we do the calculations again
        <br/>
        do we want the first element, or the last 2 elements?
        <br/>
        we def want the last 2, so let's go with those, subtracting 1 from our index
    </p>

    <p>
        and continuing this calculation, we end up with `(()())`, which is the correct answer
    </p>

    <p>
        now we just need a way to quickly compute how many ways there are to compute the # of ways to complete a set of
        parenthesis given the # of opening parenthesis and the # of closing parenthesis
        <br/>
        it's a good thing this can be doable with simple dp-
        <br/>
        let <code class="language-py">complete_ways[o][c]</code> be the # of ways to complete a par string
        given `o` opening & `c` closing parenthesis
    </p>

    <p>
        this would be the table if the total # of parentheses was 3
    </p>
    ```py
    [[5, 0, 0, 0],
     [5, 2, 0, 0],
     [3, 2, 1, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1]]
    ```

    <p>
        we have a base case of <code class="language-py">complete_ways[par_amt][par_amt] = 1</code>,
        and the recursion relation is p simple as well:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-py">complete_ways[o][c] = complete_ways[o + 1][c] + complete_ways[o][c + 1]</code></pre>

    <p>
        (given that the previous indices are defined, of course)
    </p>
</div>

<div id="code">
    <p>
        but without further ado, here's my code
    </p>

    ```py
    from typing import Optional
    from math import comb
    from functools import lru_cache


    @lru_cache
    def balanced_paren_num(par_amt: int) -> int:
        assert par_amt >= 0
        # formula from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number
        return comb(2 * par_amt, par_amt) // (par_amt + 1)


    def balanced_parens(par_amt: int, ind: int) -> Optional[str]:
        assert par_amt >= 0

        total = balanced_paren_num(par_amt)  # total number of balanced parenthesis
        # simple bounds checking
        if not 0 <= ind < total or par_amt < 0:
            return None
        if par_amt in [0, 1]:  # idk if my function can handle these cases
            return '' if par_amt == 0 else '()'

        # this[o][c] = ways to complete given o opening parenthesis & c closing parenthesis
        complete_ways = [[0 for _ in range(par_amt + 1)] for _ in range(par_amt + 1)]
        complete_ways[par_amt][par_amt] = 1
        for o in range(par_amt, -1, -1):
            for c in range(o, -1, -1):
                if o + 1 <= par_amt:
                    complete_ways[o][c] += complete_ways[o + 1][c]
                if c + 1 <= par_amt:
                    complete_ways[o][c] += complete_ways[o][c + 1]

        def actual_calc(curr_str: str, o_amt: int, c_amt: int, rel_ind: int) -> str:
            if o_amt == par_amt:
                return curr_str + ')' * (par_amt - c_amt)
            # adding the o comes before adding the c
            add_o = complete_ways[o_amt + 1][c_amt]
            if rel_ind < add_o:
                return actual_calc(curr_str + '(', o_amt + 1, c_amt, rel_ind)
            return actual_calc(curr_str + ')', o_amt, c_amt + 1, rel_ind - add_o)
        return actual_calc('', 0, 0, ind)


    print(balanced_parens(2, 0))  # should output (())
    print(balanced_parens(2, 1))  # should output ()()
    print(balanced_parens(3, 3))  # should output ()(())
    print(balanced_parens(3, 5))  # should output None
    ```
