    <title>another 2025 china trip lol</title>
</head>

<body>

<p><a href="/index.html">back to home</a></p>

<p>
    yeah this trip was actually planned before that summer one
</p>

<p>
    there wasn't even an intermediary flight from the school home-
    i just went straight from school to china and back<br/>
    for most people this prolly isn't a big deal, but it kinda is for me
</p>

<p>
    the captions in this post are pretty long, too.
    ig the photos here just warrant more explanation, but not enough
    to deserve making entire sections for each
</p>

<p>toc here again, though different tables lol:</p>

<h1 id="layover">pics during the layover in japan</h1>

<p>
    yep!
    i had to do a layover in japan (5 hours to, a day and then some on the way back)
    since the cheap flight my mom found was to 成田 near tokyo
</p>

<p>
    i didn't get anything too good there, since the place was still pretty far from tokyo proper,
    but the airport still did have some cool stuff
</p>

<p>
    this was also my very first time in japan, which is cool
</p>

    </div>
</div>
<p>
    for those who don't know ball, most voaloid songs have miku or teto dress up
    in some funky outfit or do some gimmick in the music video<br/>
    however, 99% of miku merch just puts her in the standard techy outfit that
    was displayed earlier.
    this was the first time i saw merch referring to specific songs!!
</p>

<p>
    unfortunately the gachapon only took cash, so what followed me taking this
    photo was a hectic dash across the airport in search of an atm that supported
    international transactions.
</p>

<p>
    my woes didn't stop there, as
</p>
<ol>
    <li>the minimum amount i had to withdraw was 1000 yen, more than twice what i needed</li>
    <li>there was a 220 yen transaction fee</li>
</ol>
<p>
    leaving the atm, feeling somewhat violated, i returned to this machine
    <b>ONLY TO REALIZE THAT I HADN'T NOTICED A "SOLD OUT" MARKER AT THE BOTTOM</b>
    (not displayed in the photo)
</p>

<p>
    <b><i>I WAS GENUINELY CRASHING OUT ISTG</i></b>
</p>

<p>
    i settled for pulling on a hololive charm and nikke mini figurine gachapon,
    even though i don't really engage with either of the two.
    i guess god decided to pity me, though, because on both machines i got
    exactly the character that i wanted (laplus darkness and alice)
</p>

<h1 id="solstice">apparently winter solstice is a moderate thing in china</h1>

<p>
    ok that was japan, but i know you clicked this for china photos
</p>

<p>
    first uh lemme switch to proper grammar since i feel like this one section
    needs actual respect and such
</p>

<p>
    Did you know that besides 清明节 (the Qingming Festival), the Chinese
    also pay respects to the dead on winter solstice?
    I didn't know this until a couple years ago, and since I was here this
    winter, I had the chance to pay respects to my late maternal grandmother.
</p>

<p>
    For reasons that should be obvious I didn't really feel the urge to take
    any photos in front of her memorial my maternal grandfather had set up, but it was very simple.
    It was a framed photo of her in front of some snacks and fruits.
</p>

<p>
    My aunt and cousin were also there.
    Following their lead, I took three sticks of incense, lit them with the
    candle on the side of the table, and bowed three times.
</p>

<p>
    I never was a religious, or even spiritual person.
    Sometimes I get supertitious with regards to things like my gacha luck, but that's about it.
    As I bowed, though, I found myself mumbling in disjointed English to my grandmother,
    telling her about everything that was going on in my life.
    I told her about my progress in school, my status in the job search, stuff
    that I would've told her in a video call if she was still alive.
</p>

<p>
    During that moment, more than ever, I <i>wanted</i> to believe, so, so, bad.<br/>
    That there actually was another side.<br/>
    That she was enjoying all the food on the table as I bowed three times.<br/>
    That maybe one day I'd be able to see her again.<br/>
    That all of this wasn't for nothing.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    My mom sometimes asks me if I think about her.
    "Of course," I lie, knowing damn well the number of times she's
    entered my mind in the past year would be lucky to even break double digits.
    Relatives also sometimes tell me how she'll appear in their dreams, back from the afterlife.
    She never visits mine.
</p>

<p>
    It's not even like we were distant.
    I have very fond memories of her, how she'd let me use her iPad to play Clash of Clans
    in the early morning (much to my parents' chagrin),
    or how she'd pet me as a little kid to help me go to sleep.
    She was with me all the way until high school, which all things considered is pretty good.
    Yet I remember how when my dad informed me of her passing, I just sat
    there for like five minutes until going back to gaming (Maybe I cried, I forgot).
    I probably should feel some bit of guilt for that, but I can't make myself feel anything else.
</p>

<p>
    Ok heavy topics done.
    After the incense stuff, my aunt's family took me to a nearby temple
    where they'd paid for a spot for my grandmother's nameplate to burn some fake cash.
    The idea is that it's the deads' funds in the afterlife.
    On the way to my grandfather's house that day I actually saw some people burning
    bags of it right by the street, which come to think of it is probably a fire hazard.
</p>

<p>
    That aside, this is where we burned our stuff:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="solstice/burning.jpg" class="three-quarters-img"/>
        <div class="caption">Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    I just kinda threw the bag they gave me into the flames and that was good enough.
</p>

<p>
    After that we went inside the template to pay respects to the nameplate.
    It took us a bit to find the one with her name among the hundreds of others,
    but after a minute, there it was: hung at the very top, straddled between
    two other names that I couldn't even pronounce.
</p>

<p>
    (No photos here either because I didn't think it proper to take them inside a temple.)
</p>

<p>
    And yeah, that was basically it for the memorial.
</p>

<p>
    I returned with my aunt and cousin to get some brunch
    at a nearby upscale cafe called Money Shop.
    These Chinese stores always have the most nonsensical English names, I swear.
    We ordered a latte, and I was surprised to see that they actually drew something on it!
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="solstice/latte_art.jpg" class="three-quarters-img"/>
        <div class="caption">My first time seeing latte art!</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    When I drank it, though, it surprisingly didn't disappear.
    Rather, the foam just kinda stayed on top until it deformed at the bottom of the cup.
    This photo didn't really have to do much with the previous events,
    but it happened on the same day so I figured I'd include it here.
</p>

<p>
    When I was leaving to back to my paternal grandparents' house,
    my grandpa asked me if I wanted any of the snacks he'd set out on the memorial.
    I refused, 90% out of not being hungry, but 10% out of...principle?
    I'm not even sure what principle this would be on.
    Something about eating the stuff that was supposed to be for my grandmother
    felt <i>off</i> in some way or another.
    Like yeah, she's gone, she's certainly not going to be coming back and
    having them anytime soon, but...still.
</p>

<h1 id="misc">random scenes, things, whatever</h1>

<p>
    ok back to normalspeak.
    around christmas i went to 徐家汇 (xujiahui), an intersection with a TON of malls.
    the scenery was lowk pretty, so i snapped an above average amount of photos there

<h1 id="food">they say my hunger's a problem</h1>

<p>
    a good portion of these photos are because my paternal grandfather
    wanted me to take pics whenever we ate out for lunch, which was basically every day.
    i was annoyed at the time, but i guess now i get a ton of pics for this section!
