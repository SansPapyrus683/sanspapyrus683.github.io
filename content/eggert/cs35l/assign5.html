<h1>assign 5</h1>

<p>
    out of all the assignments, this one is probably done the best<br/>
    that's not a high bar to clear though tbh
</p>

<h2>tips?</h2>

<p>
    since it's already so clear, i'll just give some implementation tips
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        a cool toposort impl for a problem can be found
        <a href="https://usaco.guide/gold/toposort?lang=py#dfs">here</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        i also found
        <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-topological-sorting/">an alternate impl</a>
        by gfg if you like that site more
    </li>
    <li>
        holy crap i just found
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html">this mega based standard library</a><br/>
        ig you have to read a bit of documentation to figure it out but once you have that down
        you don't have to touch any icky algorithms
    </li>
    <li>
        make sure to only output commits reachable from the branch heads!<br/>
        i spent ages malding over why my code was failing one of the tcs only to realize it was this
    </li>
    <li>
        besides the libraries they already gave, i found `pathlib` and `collections` to be quite helpful<br/>
        you might not have use for these libraries, though, and that's ok!
    </li>
    <li>
        the spec says to use `strace -f` to make sure you don't call any system processes,
        but it doesn't tell you what to look for<br/>
        so once you have the outputted file, just `grep` for `execve` in the resulting logs;
        there should be only calls to `python` or whatever (at least i think so?)
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>what to turn in</h2>

<p>
    `topo_order_commits.py`, which should contain a function `topo_order_commits` that runs
    everything as well as comments explaining your approach to the problem<br/>
    don't be like me and have the script run only when directly executed<br/>
    basically the file you turn in should be exactly the one that passes the pytest suite they gave
</p>

<p>
    `topo-test.tr.gz`, gen'd by running this in the test suite:
    ```bash
    strace -f -o topo-test.tr pytest
    gzip -9 topo-test.tr
    ```
