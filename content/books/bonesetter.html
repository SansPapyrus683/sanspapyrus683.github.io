<h1>i've read three amy tan books now</h1>

<p>
    <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> was in hs freshies year,
    and <i>The Kitchen God's Wife</i> was around half(?) a year ago<br/>
    can't remember if i was going to write a commentary for kitchen god
</p>

<p>
    but this review isn't about that- it's <i>The Bonesetter's Daughter</i>,
    a book which i had no idea existed til i saw it for purchase at the library<br/>
    i asked them if they took apple pay and they said i could just leave now
    and give em a donation later LMAO<br/>
    (don't worry, i gave them some money in the box the day after)
</p>

<p>
    also before i start i just wanted to show yall this amazing clip from the book just LOOK AT IT:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Ruth stood, and that's when she noticed the dampness on her bottom.
    The toilet seat had been wet! [...]
    Ruth thought about rubbing the pee off with toilet paper.
    But then she decided it was a sign, like a pledge of love.
    It was Lance's pee, his gems, and leaving it on made her feel brave and romantic.
</blockquote>

<p>
    ok that's out of the way, let the actual writing begin
</p>

<h2>couple of things</h2>

<p>
    This is a work of fiction, and I have no clue how a reflection on one of these kinds
    of books is supposed to go.
    As I sit here writing this disclaimer, the vision is that I'm going to dump
    every single vaguely introspective thought and comment I had while reading
    and hope something coherent comes out of it.
    With my attention span so short, it's a miracle I can write anything at all.
</p>

<p>
    Also, I'm pretty sure I'm not in the set of people this book is supposed to be relatable for.
    This is not unprecedented; nearly all of Amy Tan's books focus on mother-daughter relationships
    with only a dash of actual Chinese stuff here and there.
    Not saying this detracts from it being a good book, but it's just that my perspective
    might be a bit... uninformed?
    Not sure if that's the best way to describe it.
    It is what it is though, here we go.
</p>

<h2>maybe i do a bit of plot first?</h2>

<p>
    <i>The Bonesetter's Daughter</i> follows the standard Tan formula at this point.
    That's not really saying much, given that she has less than five novels published,
    but the pattern is still there.
    It's a tale of a mom, LuLing, who had a crazy life in China before immigrating to the US,
    and her ABC daughter, Ruth, who's now all grown up.
</p>

<p>gp

    It's told from both parties' perspectives.
    Ruth struggles to both connect with her mother and sort out her own life.
    while LuLing reminisces about her chaotic past in China.
    The latter's story is told in the context of an essay she writes in Chinese,
    which does require a bit of disbelief since it takes up like 100, 150 pages
    and they're just supposedly stashed in a couch(?) somewhere.
</p>

<p>
    That tiny weird thing aside, it's pretty heartwarming.
    Ruth finds the papers, reads about her mother
    (who in the book gets diagnosed with dementia), and realizes
    how it recontextualizes a lot of stuff she'd experienced as a child or whatever.
    At least I think that's how a summary would go.
</p>

<h2>random bs GO!</h2>



<p>
    First off, there's a weird supernatural thing that is mentioned only at the start and end of the book.
    It's the fact that on August 12th, Ruth always loses her voice or a week.
    After learning "to speak for herself", though, she stops ghostwriting and this supposedly was the cure
    for her lost voice.
    I don't know, it's really weird.
    There's probably some profound theming here, but it just came off as a bit forced.
</p>

<p>
    Also, for once four years of high school English somewhat paid off.
    My walnut-sized brain managed to recognize the connection between Ruth having
    to reword everything her mother said and her mother having to interpret
    whatever her mom ("Precious Auntie" in the book) said.
</p>

<p>
    But on the topic of Precious Auntie, she supposedly speaks "with her hands and eyes"
    and that's enough to tell entire paragraphs worth of stories.
    How did that even work?
    Was she slapping them together like those ninjas in, what, Naruto or whatever?
    I know it wasn't sign language, because she has to do this because
    her face got absolutely SCREWED by an attempted suicide.
    If she was born mute I guess it makes sense, but not really here.
</p>

<p>
    <b>final rating: 9/10</b>
    some parts in the middle are a little bland, but would still recc.
    p good read, and i'm not even in the target audience
