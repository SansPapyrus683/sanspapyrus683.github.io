<h2>the idea of a confidence interval</h2>

<p>
    <b>point estimate:</b> stat that's a reasonable estimate about the population parameter<br/>
    \(\hat{p} \rightarrow p\), \(\bar{x} \rightarrow \mu\), yeah yeah
</p>

<p>
    for a confidence interval (CI) (A, B),
    the pt. est. is \(\frac{A+B}{2}\), & the margin of error is \(\frac{A-B}{2}\)
</p>

<p>
    <b>interpretation:</b> "we're [x]% confident that the interval
    from [A] to [B] contains the true [parameter context]"
</p>

<p>
    CIs contain all plausible values, not even sure what this means
</p>

<h2>interpreting the confidence level</h2>

<p>
    <b>interpretation:</b> "if we've a shitton of samples & do a CI for all of 'em,
    ~[x]% of them'll capture the true [parameter context]"
</p>

<h3>margin of error</h3>

<ul>
    <li>confidence level UP, margin of error UP (wider CI)</li>
    <li>sample size (n) UP, margin of error DOWN (narrower CI)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    does acc. for sampling variability, but <b>doesn't</b> acc for nonresponse, undercoverage, or response bias
</p>

<h2>constructing a confidence interval</h2>

<h3>conditions for a CI</h3>

<ol>
    <li>random sample</li>
    <li>10% condition: \(n \leq \frac{1}{10}N \rightarrow\) independence</li>
    <li>
        large counts condition \(n\hat{p}\text{, }n(1-\hat{p}) \geq 10 \rightarrow\)
        can use normal distribution to approximate sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}\)
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>crit z-values</h3>

<ul>
    <li>90% \(z^* \approx 1.645\)</li>
    <li>95% \(z^* \approx 1.960\)</li>
    <li>99% \(z^* \approx 2.576\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    you need the normal distribution graph at minimum for work,
    but you can also include the \(\text{invNorm}\) thing if you wanna make sure
</p>

<h3>confidence interval for a value of \(\hat{p}\)</h3>

\[\hat{p} \pm z^* \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}\]

<p>
    btw the \(\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}\) is called the standard error,
    and is referred to as \(SE_{\hat{p}}\)
</p>

<p>
    <b>SIDE NOTE:</b> given that on the WS for the "parameter:" and "statistic:" question he put
    "p = true [whatever]" and "\(\hat{p}\) = point estimate of [whatever]", we should probably do that asw
</p>

<h2>estimating a pop. prop: 4-step process</h2>

<h3>4-step process</h3>

<h4>it's called the "one sample z interval for p"</h4>

<ol>
    <li><b>state:</b> parameter & confidence level</li>
    <li><b>plan:</b> name the procedure & check the conditions (rng, large counts, etc.)</li>
    <li><b>do:</b> general & specific formulas, plug in & calc</li>
    <li><b>conclude:</b> interpret interval in context</li>
</ol>

<h3>choosing \(n\)</h3>

\[ME=z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} \qquad n=\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{(\frac{ME}{z^*})^2}\]

<p>
    if you don't know \(\hat{p}\), set it as 0.5 for the worst-case scenario<br/>
    also you should <b>always round \(n\) up</b>, if you don't you'll die irl, trust me
</p>

<h2>significance tests: the basics</h2>

<h3>types of hypotheses</h3>

<p>
    \(H_0\), or "it was probably nothing": \(p\) or \(\mu\) is equal to the base claim
</p>

<p>
    \(H_a\), or "it's something.": \(p\) or \(\mu\) is &lt;, &gt;, or \(\neq\) the base claim (null value)
</p>

<p>
    <b>interpretation of P-val:</b> "assuming \(H_0\) is valid, or [ctx], there's a ~[P-val] chance of getting
    the deserved result or something more extreme due to sampling variability"
</p>

<p>
    <b>how to conclude:</b> "because the P-value [&lt;/&gt;] \(\alpha\), we [do/don't] have convincing
    evidence for \(H_a\) context"
</p>

<p>
    if the P-value is less than \(\alpha\), it's convincing<br/>
    if it's greater than \(\alpha\), it's not<br/>
    if it's exactly equal to \(\alpha\), then idk, maybe not to be more conservative<br/>
</p>

<h2>significance test for p</h2>

<p>
    <b>conditions:</b> literally the same as those of a CI
</p>

<h3>standardized test statistic (z-score)</h3>

<img src="img/packet10/normal.png" alt="normal thing" class="half-img center"/>

<p>
    couple of things about this normal plot
</p>

<ul>
    <li>\(\mu_{\hat{p}}=p\)</li>
    <li>\(\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\)- we use base p bc we're presuming the null hypo. is true</li>
    <li>\(z=\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    btw, if the p-val &lt; \(\alpha\) (5%), it's called "statistically significant",
    aka we've convincing evidence for the [ctx]
</p>

<h2>significance test for a proportion- 4 step</h2>

<p>
    alr, so i'm just gonna go through the ws this day & what he put
</p>

<h3>state: (parameter, statistic, hypotheses, significance level)</h3>

<p>
    <b>parameter:</b> p: proportion of homes <i>in flint</i> that have contaminated water<br/>
    <b>statistic:</b> \(\hat{p}=\frac{32}{140} \approx 0.22857\)<br/>
    <b>hypotheses:</b> \(H_0\): p = 0.1, \(H_a\): p &gt; 0.1<br/>
    <b>significance level: 5%</b><br/>
</p>

<h3>plan: (name & checks)</h3>

<p>
    <b>name:</b> one sample z-test for p
</p>

<h4>conditions:</h4>

<ul>
    <li><b>rng:</b> not stated but we assume a random sample. proceed w/ caution!!</li>
    <li><b>10% condition:</b> probably &gt; 140/0.1 = 1400 homes in flint</li>
    <li>
        <b>large counts condition:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>\(np \geq 10\)</li>
            <li>\(n(1-p) \geq 10\)</li>
        </ul>
        note that we use p, not \(\hat{p}\)!!
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>do: (specific formula, pic, work, p-val)</h3>

<p>
    <b>general formula (not req):</b> \(\frac{\text{stat}-\text{param}}{\text{SD stat}}\) <br/>
    <b>specific formula (yea this one is needed:</b> \(z=\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}\)
</p>

<p>
    <b>work:</b> 
    \[\begin{align}
    z &= \frac{\frac{32}{140}-0.1}{\sqrt{\frac{0.1(1-0.1)}{140}}} \\
    &= 5.071
    \end{align}\]
    <b>p-val: \(1.983 \cdot 10^{-7} \approx 0\)</b>
</p>

<h4>picture:</h4>

<img src="img/packet10/test.png" alt="test curve thing" class="center half-img"/>

<p>
    you can also use \(\mu\) and \(\sigma_{\hat{p}}\), but imo this one is easier
</p>

<h3>conclude: (interpret p-val & conclusion)</h3>

<p>
    <b>conclusion:</b> since the p-value is less than our significance level of 5%,
    we've convincing evidence that the water supply of flint is unsafe
</p>

<p>
    <b>interpretation of p-val:</b> assuming the null hypothesis is true, there's a ~0% chance that
    32/140 or more of the randomly sampled homes in flint had contaminated water
</p>

<p>
    by the way, there's this 2-sided test as well for when you just want to test inequality,
    not greater than or less than<br/>
    to do this you double the p-val & shade on both sides of the normal curve
