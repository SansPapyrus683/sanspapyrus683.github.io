<h1>sans's book reviews</h1>

<p>
    i never knew whether it was supposed to be "sans'" or "sans's"<br/>
    you pronounce it like the second though so that's what i'm doing
</p>

<p>
    this page will be updated as i try to read more so keep an eye out
</p>

<p>
    ok now for the actual book reviews i'm going to write properly,
    i think that's a tone more befitting the topic
</p>

<p>
    I'm really scared to say what I think a book is about, because
    my reading comprehension is dog and someone might flame me for it.
</p>

<p>
    Well, you only live once. Here goes!
</p>

<h2 style="color: #76ec00">peak books</h2>

<h3>wiseguy</h3>
<p>nicholas pileggi</p>

<p>
    This was the first book of Pileggi's that I read.
    I watched <i>Goodfellas</i> a couple years ago and actually
    didn't care much for the characters, but I remembered one day that
    it was based on this book and placed a hold on it.
    I think this might've been the first book where I <i>immediately</i>
    knew it was peak just by reading the first couple of sentences.
</p>

<p>
    Pileggi does this thing where he uses a metric f-ton of dialogue
    to tell his stories, so at a certain point it feels like a first-person book.
    It's pulled off <i>very</i> well, even though all the mafia terminology
    got a bit confusing for a dumba** like me sometimes.
</p>

<h3>casino: love & honor in las vegas</h3>
<p>also nicholas pileggi</p>

<p>
    Unlike with <i>Goodfellas</i>, I didn't watch <i>Casino</i> before reading this one.
    I remember hearind somewhere that the movie ran upwards of three hours long and
    that was just a massive turn off for me.
</p>

<p>
    Told in much the same way as <i>Wiseguy</i>, this book follows the rise
    and fall of the mafia in Vegas (at least I think so), and does a bit of parallel
    storytelling with both Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro.
    I'm realizing as I write this that once you've read one you've basically
    read the other, but hey! Two cakes, amirite?
</p>

<h3>blye, private eye</h3>
<p>yes, i read all three of this guy pileggi's books</p>

<p>
    It's really unfortunate he only wrote these three.
    I probably could've devoured at least like five more of this guy's books.
</p>

<p>
    This book follows a private detective and uses a bit more third person
    than the other two books.
    It's still peak regardless.
    He gives a ton of mini storylines throughout the book that are all
    neatly tied up at the end, even though according to Pileggi rarely any of
    the cases PIs are involved in have neat endings.
</p>

<h3>killers of the flower moon</h3>
<p>david grann</p>

<p>
    I somewhat wanted to watch the movie, but I didn't really have time and saw this
    in a Shanghai bookstore I was browsing one day and so decided to read it on a whim.
    Boy was I glad.
</p>

<p>
    This was actually the book that got me to google more nonfiction books
    that were written like fiction.
    There's a good amount of photos throughout, and I found myself silently rooting
    for the investigators as the book wound on.
</p>

<h3>devil in the white city</h3>
<p>erik larson</p>

<p>
    This book is really two in one.
    Half the chapters tell the building of the Chicago World's Fair,
    while the other half tell the story of H. H. Holmes, one of the 19th century's
    most notorious serial killers.
</p>

<p>
    Larson does this thing where he won't reveal the name of an entity until
    later in the book for spoiler reasons, and I think it's a pretty cool
    thing to do in a nonfiction book.
    The foreshadowing does get a bit too obvious, sometimes.
    I predicted one of the major plot points like a whole half
    of the book before it actually happened, and I spent way too long
    just waiting for it to get to the actual point.
</p>

<p>
    Also some Reddit thread says that half the H. H. Holmes story is, like,
    fabricated, so read this at your own risk? I guess?
    Nevertheless, this book is still peak.
</p>

<h3>the orchid thief</h3>
<p>susan orlean</p>

<p>
    I read the synopsis thinking it was gonna be about the actual court case,
    but no, like 80% of it is just the author dicking around Florida and
    yapping with others about orchids.
    It's fun yapping, no doubt, but I can't lie- I felt a bit cheated
    after seeing the conflict the cover flaps advertised resolved in such a simpler manner.
</p>

<p>
    There's not even a proper ending.
    Maybe there's a reason for that which English teachers
    could make their kids write a whole essay on, but it kinda left a bad taste in my mouth.
</p>

<p>
    So yeah, not the <i>best</i> book, but it's still fine.
    I don't really regret reading it.
</p>

<h3>don quixote</h3>
<p>miguel cervantes</p>

<p>
    After seeing a bunch of fanart of Limbus Company's DQ, I really wanted to like this book.
    (I read this before knowing of the character I think.)
</p>

<p>
    It's a fine book, but there's just way too many tangents.
    Certain segments were pretty amusing though!
    The humor holds up surprisngly well after a couple centuries.
    I can't say I laughed, but I certainly wasn't bored.
</p>

<p>
    Actually, there was <i>one</i> part where I busted my gut laughing.
    I'll leave it to y'all to guess which one it was.
</p>

<p>
    The way the book works is that it's kinda-sorta split into segments
    that are basically independent of each other besides a couple of callbacks.
    If all you knew was the premise and I flipped you to the random start
    of a segment, you'd have basically no problem reading on.
</p>

<h3>hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy</h3>
<p>douglas adams</p>

<p>
    The only good thing about this book is that you get to see where all
    the references in <i>The Impossible Quiz</i> and the occassional Reddit comment
    come from.
</p>

<p>
    This series tries <i>so hard</i> to be funny, and yet, I think I only laughed
    once throughout the entire 700-odd pages of the book.
    The main mechanism it uses to try to get a laugh is sheer absurdism,
    but nearly all of it falls flat.
    After most of the jokes, I just sat there, like, "ok".
</p>

<p>
    So yeah.
    Don't waste your time.
</p>

<h3>catch-22</h3>
<p>joseph heller</p>

<p>
    Imagine reading a mathematical proof, but all the paragraphs are out of order.
</p>

<p>
    I think one of the cover quotes was something like "This is the only war novel that makes any sense."
    What the hell was that person on?
