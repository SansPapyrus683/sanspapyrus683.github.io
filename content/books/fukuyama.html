    <blockquote>
        But we should not be surprised if all of the formerly communist countries do not make a rapid a smooth
        transition to democracy; in fact, it would be very surprising if this did happen.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        [W]hile China continues to be a dictatorship, the regime has lost control of significant parts of society.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Yet the monumental failure of Marxism as a basis for real-world societies- plainly evident 140 years after The
        Communist Manifesto
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        These new, democratically elected leaders started from the premise that underdevelopment was not due to the
        inherent inequities of capitalism, but rather to the insufficient degree of capitalism that had been practiced
        in their countries in the past.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        The persistence of war and military competition among nations is thus, paradoxically, a great unifier of
        nations.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Since the term ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù has acquired so many pejorative connotations over the years, it has recently become
        a fashion to speak of ‚Äúfree-market economics‚Äù instead.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        the United States spent much more than it produced through a series of mounting budget deficits, constraining
        future economic growth and the choices of future generations in order to maintain a high level of present
        consumption
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        ‚Äúit is the very nature of politics to compel the actor on the political scene to use ideologies to disguise the
        immediate goal of his action,‚Äù which was always power.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        And they crave sex because it- well, feels good.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        A Universal History need not justify every tyrannical regime and every war
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        this quote doesn't seem too bad, until you realize a couple pages later he states that
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        A true Universal History of mankind would have to be able to explain [‚Ä¶] the discontinuous and unexpected
        [evolutionary trends]
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        this isn't even the only time he says nonsense stuff!
        take a gander at this quote:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        There are, nonetheless, several fallacies about culture and democracy that should be avoided. The first is the
        notion that cultural factors constitute sufficient conditions for the establishment of democracy.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        and then the later quote:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        The second [‚Ä¶] is to view cultural factors as necessary conditions for the establishment of democracy.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        democratic capitalist societies were markedly un-warlike and anti-imperialistic
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        the truth is that [capitalist societies] are far more egalitarian in their social effects than the agricultural
        societies they replaced.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        But in a democracy we are fundamentally averse to saying that a certain person, or way of life, or activity, is
        better and more worthwhile than another.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        A liberal democracy that could fight a short and decisive war every generation or so [...] would be far
        helathier and more satisfied than one that expereicned nothing but continuous peace.
    </blockquote>
