<h1>anime expo!!!</h1>

<p>
    it's finally happened!
</p>

<p>
    ya boy finally went to his first anime convention
</p>

<p>
    actually not really, since i went w/ my family to a smaller one in shanghai before,
    but i don't really think that counts
</p>

<p>
    i debated a little whether or not to use Proper Grammar over discordspeak,
    but imo this makes it flow better, feel free to crucify me if you disagree
</p>

<h2>preamble</h2>

<p>
    my good friend <a href="https://idkac.github.io/">idkac</a>
    actually went to <a href="https://idkac.github.io/content/animeExpo.html">ax</a>
    last year with another friend <a href="https://byfqjczj.github.io/">conservemomenta</a>,
    but iirc during that time i was either in china or caught working so i couldn't go, sadge
</p>

<p>
    thankfully this year i remembered the event existed and wanted to go along
</p>

<p>
    also, i know arknights isn't too big of a gacha game so some people might
    get irked by the amt of ak photos i took since i'm a huge fan of it.
    yall don't have to worry; i've moved all of them down
    to <a href="#ak">the bottom of the page</a>, though they
    <i>are</i> all across different days so, uh, cry about it idk
</p>

<h2>day 1</h2>

<p>
    though our flights were at 6 am, idkac wanted to <i>start</i> ubering over there at
    three in the morning for literally no reason.
    i got up at 2:30 to make some final preparations and was ready by then,
    but this man decides to <i>sleep past his alarm</i> and only get up at 3:30,
    so there's that.
</p>

<p>
    anyways, we got to the con by around 11, and we got our first photo
    before we even walked in:
</p>

<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day1/miku_guy.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">
            they were a guy, too. hella based.
            i only knew they were because of their voice, by appearance
            alone i thought he was a girl LOL
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    the cosplayer was a guy too, which was hella based.
    (we could tell by the voice, initially i thought he was a girl looool)
</p>

<p>
    i bought my ticket late because i'd mistakenly assumed idkac bought it for me,
    so we spent like 20 minutes searching for the place you were supposed to claim the tickets
</p>

<p>
    after that he went off for some blue archive panel event, so i was left to my own devices.
    here's some photos i took by myself:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day1/gura.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">gawr gura; the cosplayer's friend took the photo</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day1/spy.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">tf2 spy; his friend who took the photo was wearing a kris sweater</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day1/helldivers.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">a lot of my friends play helldivers so i took this</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day1/teto.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">teto is pretty cool</div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    while walking around the entertainment hall by myself, though, i struck veritable <b><i>GOLD</i></b>:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day1/lesley.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">LESLEY FROM TCOAAL???</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    i did NOT expect to find any funny game cosplayers here, but there i was.
    she told me i was the second person to ask for a photo, too!
</p>

<p>
    i also got some blue archive cosplayer photos to make idkac jealous
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day1/ba_bunny.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">i'm not sure which bunny girl this is; asuna <i>maybe?</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day1/ba_maid.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">that maid from blue archive (also a guy)</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    but soon enough the panel finished.
    after lunch at a mexican place nearby we went to artist's alley,
    a place where hundreds of artists were selling various trinkets and prints.
    idkac has the brain of a snail so it took him ages just to finish looking at a single booth
</p>

<p>
    i also got this sweet photo:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day1/rabbit_hole.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">
            a male & female version of
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSW2LVbPThw">rabbit hole miku</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    rabbit hole was actually my most played spotify song in 2024,
    and will stetson's cover of it was in my top 5.
    idk man, the song just goes <i>that</i> hard.
</p>

<p>
    by the way, the con started on july 3rd, 2025.
    famous vtuber gura reincarnated as saba on june 28, 2025.
    as we were walking through there were already prints and stuff of her.
    absolutely <i>insane</i> production time, if i do say so myself.
</p>

<p>
    here's the rest of the cosplayers i got before we went home:
</p>

    </div>
</div>

<h2>day 2</h2>

<p>
    this was the day conservemomenta (i'll refer to him by conserve from now on)
    arrived because he was an absolute bum and didn't want to take off one
    extra day from work for the expo
</p>

<p>
    but let's start with some more photos:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/reimu.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">a male & female version of reimu (again)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/medic.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">
            medic tf2. i'm ngl i did NOT expect to see tf2 cosplayers here,
            but BOY am i glad there are
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/megumin.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">guy dressed as megumin from konosuba</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/hk.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">the knight from hollow knight</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/ba_os_girl.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">another blue archive character i kinda forgor</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/kaguya.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">i'm only 99% sure this is kaguya from love is war</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/shiori.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">vtuber shiori novella</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/kakeguri.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">i'm not even kakeguri idk why i took this pic</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    at this point i realized that despite near all of blue archive's characters
    being female, near half of the cosplayers of the game i'd met were guys.
    so, there's that.
</p>

<p>
    astute readers might've noticed that in the photos now i'm dressed
    as <a href="https://omori.wiki/Sunny">sunny</a> from omori!
    i've gotten into a teensy bit of cosplaying recently, which is <i>really</i> unfortunate
    for someone as ugly as i am
</p>

<p>
    but i didn't wanna go to the con empty handed and sunny has a fairly simple outfit,
    so i did the best i could without makeup.
    when taking some photos i tried to give off the deadpan expression he always has in the game,
    but only when i was going through the photos did i realize i just looked sleepy as hell.
</p>

<p>
    that day was also when i found out ax had these cosplay meetups,
    and the one for omori was on the first day.
    truly unlucky, but there wasn't anything i could've done, so it is what it is.
</p>

<p>
    and here's some things that i thought were a bit more notable.
    first off, someone put these random tcoaal cutoffs on the balcony,
    idk if it was for some event or whatever:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/tcoaal.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">leyley and julia(?)</div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    we were also going through artist's alley when conserve
    runs up to idkac and me saying that there's
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1443200/Class_of_09/">class of '09</a>
    cosplayers here
</p>
<p>
    it was really crowded so i was practically shoving my way up there.
    thankfully, i didn't lose them and got to witness peak:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/co09.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">nicole and jecka</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    unfortunately they didn't tell me to off myself,
    but you can't get eveything you want in this world
</p>

<p>
    and here's some pics i took during the afternoon.
    the arknights cosplay meetup was also this day,
    but the photos for that are in the ak section so scroll down if you wanna
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">

        <div class="caption">
            wadanohara and the great blue sea's titular character.
            i've only seen instagram edits of the game so i have no real clue abt the plot lol
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day2/zzz.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">zhu yuan & evelyn chevalier from zenless zone zero</div>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>day 3</h2>

<p>
    conserve decided to dip to do some standard LA tourist stuff.
    cringe.
</p>

<p>
    but i'll first put all the photos i got here-
    the funny stuff's gonna be after.
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day3/touch_grass.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">

        <div class="caption">

        <div class="caption">tf2 ms. pauling</div>

        <div class="caption">marisa from touhou</div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    but with those photos out of the way, i need to make fun of idkac here<br/>
    we were walking down artist's alley at the usual snail's pace when we got to this:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day3/idkac_degeneracy.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">oh my god...</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    normal people (me) would've just laughed and moved on.
    maybe we would've talked about it with some friends we knew and poked fun at that.
    but <i><b>no</b></i>, idkac BOUGHT ONE OF THESE STICKERS!!!
    (it was the topmost rightmost one with the black stocking.)
    ask him and he'll prolly say it was "for a friend", but he knows
    damn well what he's gonna do with that sticker.
</p>

<p>
    also, as we were about the leave the con, we saw this cosplayer dressed as peak:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day3/sagiri.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">sagiri from eromanga sensei</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    i actually also got a photo w/ another sagiri back in china,
    but this one's outfit is a bit more standard.
    she had the mask, drawing tablet and everything, it was actually insane.
    (gwen from league is also back there lol)
</p>

<h2>day 4</h2>

<p>
    and just like that we were at the last day.
</p>

<p>
    this day was also the most stressful out of the rest.
    my buffoon self actually forgot that by checkout day you were supposed
    to leave with all your stuff in the morning, so i just thought
    "oh hey, i'll just go to the con and come back in the afternoon before i go to the airport!"
    little did i know.
</p>

<p>
    the airbnb owner contacted us at 11 saying all the stuff had to be out by like noon,
    so i had to call an uber there and back all because i didn't wanna lug a dinky
    suitcase around for a couple hours.
</p>

<p>
    in the morning idkac and conserve decided to go to the adults-only portion of artist's alley.
    i forgot my id and they didn't take pictures, so i couldn't go with them &#128557;<br/>
    they called me inside and asked if i wanted a sexy print of thorns from arknights.
    naturally, i told them to go kick rocks
</p>

<p>
    also, today was the only day i actually got asked for pictures.
    here's two of them:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day4/angel.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">another angel devil whose friend likes omori apparently</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day4/basil.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">headspace basil</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    there was also a mari cosplayer, but i didn't get any photos on my own phone.
    all i have to remember her by is the plastic apple she gave me from her picnic basket:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day4/apple.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">one of those fake apples that comes in kids' play sets or smth</div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    but enough about me.
    here's the photos i got that day:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day4/ba_cat.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">some random blue archive character</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day4/hk.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">some hollow knight character, idk who</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day4/jecka.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">another jecka cosplayer. no nicole this time unfortunately</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">

        <div class="caption">tf2 sniper AND scout</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">

        <div class="caption">tf2 engineer</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day4/sniper.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">tf2 sniper (holy crap three tf2 cosplayers???)</div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    and to top things all off, here was the final cosplayer photo i took as we were leaving:
</p>
<div class="image-grid">
    <div class="image-item">
        <img src="day4/vamp_gura.jpg"/>
        <div class="caption">the vampire girl from that vampire anime & another gawr gura</div>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 id="ak">arknights dump</h2>

<p>
    no real commentary here.
    how the meetup worked was that there was a host & cameraman
    tha would call up various related subsets of characters to take photos.
    there was also a table handing out prints & stickets, which was cool
</p>

<p>
    a good number of cosplayers spoke chinese too, lol
</p>

<p>
    but besides that i don't have much to say.
    arknights photo dump GO!

    it really means a lot that even one person wants to listen to what i want to say.
