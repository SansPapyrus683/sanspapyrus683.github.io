<h2>actual commentary</h2>

<h3>intro</h3>

<p>
    <i>Bowling Alone</i> by Robert Putnam laments the loss of community
    that has occurred in America starting somewhere with the baby boomers
    and has not stopped even after he published the book.
    Although many members of my generation may feel a sort of knee-jerk
    disgust at this take, I found hearing him out to be very enlightening.
    After reading it, I've found that I agree with the central takes
    as well as with a ton of the sub-arguments he crafts throughout
    this <i>thicc</i> book.
    Thus, I have a feeling this write-up might be a bit shorter than the others.
    Really, opposition to something does truly give you the most content, huh.
    (not like anyone reads these...)
</p>

<p>
    The other two books my boy Ross recommended me mention the loss of
    community that has occurred, with one talking about it the context
    of the American upper class another discussing how liberal democracies
    in general have a "lack of commitment" from their citizens
    (which I frankly think is BS, but this isn't about that book).
    <i>Bowling Alone</i> manages to put cold hard numbers on the arguments
    I've seen two times already, and <i>god</i> are the numbers convincing.
    Assuming he didn't cook the books or mess up any statistical analysis,
    Putnam paints an extremely convincing picture portraying the loss
    of American community.
    Before we get started, I should probably carry over from the
    book is "social capital", which in his words,
</p>
<blockquote>
    refers to the connections among individualsâ€”
    social networks and the norms of reciprocity and
    trustworthiness that arise from them.
</blockquote>
<p>
    It's basically how well-connected you are.
</p>

<p>
    But before I get into the nitty-gritty, allow me to point out that
    the blurb on the back and Putnam himself make a big deal
    about the decline in league bowling (what the hell is that, anyways?) being
    a microcosm of the general loss of community in the US.
    Putnam then procees to apply the bowling metaphor a total of two,
    <i>maybe</i> three times, throughout the entire 400-page book.
    I suppose the metaphor does make for a catchy title, but maybe
    follow up on your title a bit more?
    Or is this just the meta among social commentaries that use catchy titles?
</p>

<h3>pretty cool book</h3>

<p>
    But anyways, onto the actual content of the book.
    The book is pretty thick, clocking in at a previously mentioned 400 pages.
    The thing is a lot of it is just Putnam going through
    every single possible measure of social/civic engagement or every single
    possible cause of the current levels of societal disengagement
    that he argues is prevalent.
    I suppose it is necessary to be rigorous, but it sure as hell
    doesn't make the book interseting.
    One benefit to the rigor of Putnam's arguments in contrast to
    the anectodal examples provided by Brooks or the philosophical arguments
    by Fukuyama is that you simply can't argue with any of what he says.
    I praised Fukuyama for walking the reader through his arguments like a
    mathematical proof, but Putnnam uses <i>actual</i> math, which
    is much harder to argue against.
</p>

<p>
    I also see evidence of his arguments in my personal life.
    Even though everyone came to the general Association for Computing Machinery
    (ACM) meeting where the officers hyped everyone up about the bajillion
    subcommittees in the club, no one actually came to the meetings where you programmed.
    I think at one of the AI workshops, the officers outnumbered the
    actual participants, which either funny or sad: I'm still not sure which.
    There was even a training session for a programming
    contest where literally <i>no one came</i>.
    That was just sad.
    This <i>could</i> be blamed on the club just not being interesting,
    but I've noticed the same thing happening at a bunch of other clubs as well.
</p>

<p>
    One thing I was itching for him to address is that stronger community
    bonds are intuitively contradictory with personal liberties and mutual
    tolerance.
    If everyone is so close-knit, then one would think that any deviation
    from the general views of the group is going to be met with insult,
    derision, and possibly even ostracization.
    The great thing is, Putnam actually addresses this in chapter 22!
    Churches aside (for obvious reasons), Putnam noted a surprising
    positive correlation between social capital and acceptance of
    unpopular political opinions.
    But come to think of it, if people are closer together and do more things
    together, it's only natural that they'll be supportive if one of them voiced
    a wayward opinion or came out as whatever.
    If you game with a friend every week, you're much more likely to
    accept them if they told you they wanted to transition because
    you know them so goddamned well.
    Again, churches are the one exception to this, but <i>tons</i> of
    other forms of social bonding exist.
</p>

<p>
    Another great observation Putnam makes is that internet groups are
    united primarily by <i>common interest</i> instead of personal connection.
    In a Discord server dedicated to say, Geometry Dash, people are probably
    only going to talk about Geometry Dash.
    It's a bit hard to make friends through these servers because nearly
    all interactions you have with other people have to be through that
    common interest, and many servers actually ban "off-topic" conversation.
</p>

<h3>couple things...</h3>

<p>
    My agreement with Putnam is tainted by one flaw I've found in the book.
    It occurs in section three, where he attempts to link greater social
    engagement with good things like child welfare, education, and
    even the very fate of democracy itself.
    Now, given that social capital has supposedly been declining over
    the past couple decades, we would expect these things to be
    declining as well.
    However, only in the chapter about health does he support his argument
    by presenting a simultaneous decline in the health of Americans as well
    as their social capital.
    In no other chapter about the benefits of social capital does
    he mention a sort of decline in the later 20th century.
    Sure, he throws a ton of studies that show a positive correlation
    between social capital and whatever benefit the chapter is about at us,
    but he does not mention that said benefit has been decreasing as well.
    Perhaps benefits might be correlated when you sample across
    multiple locations at once, but not when you sample one location
    across a long time?
    Maybe there just isn't evidence gathered on this, but Putnam usually
    makes notes of any lack of evidence in the other chapters.
    I would really like to believe that he's correct, but this striking
    omission makes me doubt this entire section about the impacts
    of social capital.
</p>

<p>
    Also, like with Fukuyama, there's a certain humor in reading the
    predictions and goals he makes at the end of the book knowing what happens
    in the next quarter century.
    It's even funnier that he lists the exact year he wants them to happen.
    14 years after the deadline for his goals, let's see how some of them hold up!
    Since there's so darn many, I'll just give two of them:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Let us find ways to ensure that by 2010 America's workplace
    will be substantially more family-friendly and community-congenial, so
    that American workers will be enabled to replenish our stocks of social
    capital both within and outside the workplace.
</blockquote>
<p>
    At the time of this writing, Amazon still exists and Elon Musk is trying
    to restart the concept of the <i>company town</i>.
    I don't think workplaces have gotten any more friendlier.
    Maybe I'm having a reading comprehension moment by only focusing on
    they lives of blue-collar workers, but I feel like they take up
    a large enough fraction of the American populace for my points
    to render this goal as failed.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Let us find ways to ensure
    that by 2010 Americans will spend less leisure time sitting passively alone
    in front of glowing screens and more time in active connection with our
    fellow citizens. Let us foster new forms of electronic entertainment and
    communication that reinforce community engagement rather than
    forestalling it.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Two words: Tik Tok.
</p>

<p>
    I think it's safe to say that this goal failed miserably.
    Or maybe we actually did achieve it in 2010, only for it to backslide horrendously.
    Ever since COVID, online content really has only gotten more and more infested
    with brainrot and meaningless drivel since the early 2000s, both of which probably
    don't foster mush social capital among the masses.
    With the advent of generative AI, I'm really starting to believe
    in that
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">dead internet theory</a>
    people talk about.
</p>

<h3>final rating</h3>

<p>
    8/10,
    although its takes are great, listing off statistics does get a bit boring at times
