<h1>sans's book reviews</h1>

<p>
    i never knew whether it was supposed to be "sans'" or "sans's"<br/>
    you pronounce it like the second though so that's what i'm doing
</p>

<p>
    this page will be updated as i try to read more so keep an eye out
</p>

<p>
    ok now for the actual book reviews i'm going to write properly,
    i think that's a tone more befitting the topic
</p>

<p>
    I'm really scared to say what I think a book is about, because
    my reading comprehension is dog and someone might flame me for it.
</p>

<p>
    Well, you only live once. Here goes!
</p>

<h2 style="color: #76ec00">peak books</h2>

<h3>wiseguy</h3>
<p>nicholas pileggi</p>

<p>
    This was the first book of Pileggi's that I read.
    I watched <i>Goodfellas</i> a couple years ago and actually
    didn't care much for the characters, but I remembered one day that
    it was based on this book and placed a hold on it.
    I think this might've been the first book where I <i>immediately</i>
    knew it was peak just by reading the first couple of sentences.
</p>

<p>
    Pileggi does this thing where he uses a metric f-ton of dialogue
    to tell his stories, so at a certain point it feels like a first-person book.
    It's pulled off <i>very</i> well, even though all the mafia terminology
    got a bit confusing for a dumba** like me sometimes.
</p>

<h3>casino: love & honor in las vegas</h3>
<p>also nicholas pileggi</p>

<p>
    Unlike with <i>Goodfellas</i>, I didn't watch <i>Casino</i> before reading this one.
    I remember hearind somewhere that the movie ran upwards of three hours long and
    that was just a massive turn off for me.
</p>

<p>
    Told in much the same way as <i>Wiseguy</i>, this book follows the rise
    and fall of the mafia in Vegas (at least I think so), and does a bit of parallel
    storytelling with both Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro.
    I'm realizing as I write this that once you've read one you've basically
    read the other, but hey! Two cakes, amirite?
</p>

<h3>blye, private eye</h3>
<p>yes, i read all three of this guy pileggi's books</p>

<p>
    It's really unfortunate he only wrote these three.
    I probably could've devoured at least like five more of this guy's books.
</p>

<p>
    This book follows a private detective and uses a bit more third person
    than the other two books.
    It's still peak regardless.
    He gives a ton of mini storylines throughout the book that are all
    neatly tied up at the end, even though according to Pileggi rarely any of
    the cases PIs are involved in have neat endings.
</p>

<h3>killers of the flower moon</h3>
<p>david grann</p>

<p>
    I somewhat wanted to watch the movie, but I didn't really have time and saw this
    in a Shanghai bookstore I was browsing one day and so decided to read it on a whim.
    Boy was I glad.
</p>

<p>
    This was actually the book that got me to google more nonfiction books
    that were written like fiction.
    There's a good amount of photos throughout, and I found myself silently rooting
    for the investigators as the book wound on.
</p>

<h3>devil in the white city</h3>
<p>erik larson</p>

<p>
    This book is really two in one.
    Half the chapters tell the building of the Chicago World's Fair,
    while the other half tell the story of H. H. Holmes, one of the 19th century's
    most notorious serial killers.
</p>

<p>
    Larson does this thing where he won't reveal the name of an entity until
    later in the book for spoiler reasons, and I think it's a pretty cool
    thing to do in a nonfiction book.
    The foreshadowing does get a bit too obvious, sometimes.
    I predicted one of the major plot points like a whole half
    of the book before it actually happened, and I spent way too long
    just waiting for it to get to the actual point.
</p>

<p>
    Also some Reddit thread says that half the H. H. Holmes story is, like,
    fabricated, so read this at your own risk? I guess?
    Nevertheless, this book is still peak.
</p>

<h3>the radium girls</h3>
<p>kate moore</p>

<p>
    The book starts out okay.
    There's a bit too many characters that are introduced, seemingly willy-nilly.
    Though from the start, basically <b>all</b> of them are tagged with death.
    Every other sentence describing stuff like how they ignorantly painted radium onto their faces
    made me say, out loud, "oh <i>no</i>."
</p>

<p>
    Moore pulls no punches in describing their conditions.
    I winced as she described every awful thing the radium did to those poor womens' bodies.
    A good number of the people introduced are dead by the first third.
</p>

<p>
    It's in the last third, though, where Moore really locks TF in, describing one particular group of womens'
    lawsuit against the company that made them work with radium paint.
    I can't lie, I cried.
    Every sentence drips with grief and scorn for the scummy corpos that tried to dodge liability at every step of the way,
    and I was on the edge of my seat (metaphorically, of course) in anticipation of the verdict.
</p>

<p>
    Absolute cinema, this book.
    Can't recommend it enough.
</p>

<h3>the wager</h3>
<p>david grann</p>

<p>
    Yeah, another Grann book.
    This one was written after COVID, but I didn't know that
    until it contained a reference to <i>social distancing</i> of all things!
</p>

<p>
    Though the synopsis sets you up for a <i>Lord of the Flies</i>-esque story
    where everyone becomes nothing more than savages by the end, the actual
    story that's told comes nowhere close to that.
    I lowkey found it a bit anticlimactic.
</p>

<p>
    However, the actual history of the events doesn't take away from the writing in the slightest.
    Grann constructs his characters in such an elegant manner that at a certain
    point I forgot these were real people that he had to learn about
    through primary sources and whatnot.
</p>

<p>
    All in all, peak book.
    <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> does still have it beat, though.
</p>

<h3>on the run</h3>
<p>gina & gregg hill</p>

<p>
    As much as <i>Wiseguy</i> tried to show the downfall of Henry Hill in an unflattering
    way, it still romanticized the gangster life in some respect.
    This book shatters whatever is left of that.
</p>

<p>
    Written by his kids, it starts around the end of the Lufthansa heist.
    Even at the beginning, when they're still in primary school, Gina and Gregg
    pull no punches in chronicling their father's horrific parenting and abuse,
    from dealing cocaine in the house to hosting depraved orgies.
</p>

<p>
    After that it shifts to the part of the story <i>Wiseguy</i> never covered,
    probably because Henry had nothing going from him after the gangster life.
    This is where the conflicts really start to heat up, especially when
    Gregg grows up and is able to put up more of a fight.
</p>

<p>
    Reading this felt like watchig a car crash in slow motion.
    It was horrific, but something about it just made me keep on reading
    to see if any miracle would happen and change the family for the better.
    Things did get better, but only at the very end, where- actually,
    maybe I won't say anything for the sake of spoilers.
</p>

<p>
    Just read it yourself- it's good.
</p>

<h2 style="color: yellow">okay books</h2>

<p>
    These are books that got me on the hook throughout, but I can
    only say I <i>somewhat</i> enjoyed reading them.
    They certainly aren't a waste of time, but I can't call these <i>peak</i>.
</p>

<h3>the orchid thief</h3>
<p>susan orlean</p>

<p>
    I read the synopsis thinking it was gonna be about the actual court case,
    but no, like 80% of it is just the author dicking around Florida and
    yapping with others about orchids.
    It's fun yapping, no doubt, but I can't lie- I felt a bit cheated
    after seeing the conflict the cover flaps advertised resolved in such a simpler manner.
</p>

<p>
    There's not even a proper ending.
    Maybe there's a reason for that which English teachers
    could make their kids write a whole essay on, but it kinda left a bad taste in my mouth.
</p>

<p>
    So yeah, not the <i>best</i> book, but it's still fine.
    I don't really regret reading it.
</p>

<h3>don quixote</h3>
<p>miguel cervantes</p>

<p>
    After seeing a bunch of fanart of Limbus Company's DQ, I really wanted to like this book.
    (I read this before knowing of the character I think.)
</p>

<p>
    It's a fine book, but there's just way too many tangents.
    Certain segments were pretty amusing though!
    The humor holds up surprisngly well after a couple centuries.
    I can't say I laughed, but I certainly wasn't bored.
</p>

<p>
    Actually, there was <i>one</i> part where I busted my gut laughing.
    I'll leave it to y'all to guess which one it was.
</p>

<p>
    The way the book works is that it's kinda-sorta split into segments
    that are basically independent of each other besides a couple of callbacks.
    If all you knew was the premise and I flipped you to the random start
    of a segment, you'd have basically no problem reading on.
</p>

<h3>journey to the center of the earth</h3>
<p>jules verne</p>

<p>
    Real quick, props to the title for being such a concise description of what goes on.
    Like yeah, I sure as hell did read a journey to the center of the earth.
</p>

<p>
    I actually had to read an abridged Chinese version of this book in my
    middle school's Chinese immersion program.
    In my mind I believed they gutted like 90% of the book, but turns out the original
    thing is just as short, clocking in at around 250 pages.
</p>

<p>
    It's an ok, self-contained little read.
    I'd read 20k Leagues next, but I already finished it in middle school
    and there's nothing I hate more than rereading books (besides being drawn and quartered or whatever).
</p>

<h3>all the president's men</h3>
<p>bob woodward & carl bernstein</p>

<p>
    The writing style of this book is very unique.
    It's about Watergate and is written by the people who broke the whole thing.
    They talk about themselves in the third person, and they only directly
    quote others- never themselves.
    So yeah, the journalistic writing is pretty cool and I'd read another one with a similar style.
</p>

<p>
    I'm putting this in OK, though, since despite the book's best efforts at
    the start to remind me who each of the bajillion names are in the White House,
    I still forgot and had to look crap up on Wikipedia.
    The plot also got a bit scattered towards the end, and it lowk kinda lost me.
    Most likely a skill issue, but this is <i>my</i> book review, not others'.
</p>

<h3>the spy and the traitor</h3>
<p>ben macintyre</p>

<p>
    Who doesn't love a good spy story?
    This book follows the life of Oleg Gordievsky, a KGB spy who worked as a double agent for MI6.
    Though told more like nonfiction than fiction, I still found all the various
    spy splots intriguing enough to keep my attention.
</p>

<p>
    For some reason, despite the book telling us his real name and giving us
    a photo of him and his house, the epilogue says that he lives under an assumed name.
    My brother in Christ, what is the point of the anonymity if some schmuck
    with a tape recorder is going to come and dox you anyways?
</p>

<h2 style="color: red">dogwater books</h2>

<h3>hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy</h3>
<p>douglas adams</p>

<p>
    The only good thing about this book is that you get to see where all
    the references in <i>The Impossible Quiz</i> and the occassional Reddit comment
    come from.
</p>

<p>
    This series tries <i>so hard</i> to be funny, and yet, I think I only laughed
    once throughout the entire 700-odd pages of the book.
    The main mechanism it uses to try to get a laugh is sheer absurdism,
    but nearly all of it falls flat.
    After most of the jokes, I just sat there, like, "ok".
</p>

<p>
    So yeah.
    Don't waste your time.
</p>

<h3>catch-22</h3>
<p>joseph heller</p>

<p>
    Imagine reading a mathematical proof, but all the paragraphs are out of order.
</p>

<p>
    I think one of the cover quotes was something like "This is the only war novel that makes any sense."
    What the hell was that person on?
